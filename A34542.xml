            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HERE thou haſt the Remains of the Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> late of <hi>Chicheſter;</hi> Thoſe that knew him ſay, That he was a man endued with the wiſdom that is from above, that is firſt pure, and then peaceable, gentle, (meek, moderate,) and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without hypocriſie. Therefore it is conceived that any thing which he had deſigned for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſe, may be well accepted of, by all thoſe that deſire to follow after peace with all men, ſo far as is conſiſtent with purity. Whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe Remains of his be not to vindicate the truth, and to promote purity firſt, and then peace, is left to thee to judg, after thou haſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially peruſed and conſidered them in the

Thou haſt them juſt as they were left under his own hand; if himſelf had lived to publiſh them, thou mighteſt poſſibly have had them better Poliſht: but it is not thought fit that any other perſon ſhould take upon him to alter any thing in them.</p>

               <head>§ 1. <hi>Of the Church and Miniſtry, as related to each other.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHETHER the Church, or the Miniſtry be firſt in nature, is to be conſidered; that for the more orderly, handling of both, we may know which of them to begin with. For that ſeems to require the precedency of handling, that hath the priority of nature; or the being whereof, is preſuppoſed to the being of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now ſome have thus reſolved it: As the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Hen or the Egg be firſt, is reſolved by the Creation, That God made the Hen firſt; ſo is the Queſtion, Whether the Church or Miniſtry be firſt, by the conſideration of the firſt Inſtitution of Chriſt; And it appears that the Miniſtry was firſt Inſtituted, or at leaſt that it was firſt in exiſtence. In ſetting up the Chriſtian Church, Chriſt ſet up the Miniſtry firſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert men, or make them Chriſtians. Moreover, the Miniſtry, as taken for the collective body of Miniſters, is a conſtitutive part of the Church, conſidered not <hi>entitativè,</hi> but <hi>organicè,</hi> (as ſome Phraſe the diſtinction); that is, not as a meer company of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers gathered to Chriſt, but as a Political Society, or Spiritual Commonwealth in this World. And the Conſtitutive parts ſhould be diſtinctly treated of, before the Whole that is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of them.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64714:4"/>
               <p>On the other hand, the Church is the end of the Miniſtry, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and in deſign or intention, before it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Miniſtry hath a reſpect of ſubſerviency to the Church, and is Adapted to the ſtate thereof. Likewiſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is in the Church, as the leſſer in the greater, as a part in the whole; as a thing reſiding, in the ſeat of its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; as Stewardſhip in a Family. This indeed holds princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and perpetually of the Church Univerſal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. Moreover, the Miniſters power and vertue is theirs, as they are the Churches, which indeed hath the propriety of them, and their Miniſterial gifts, as being all under God and Chriſt, finally for its behoof. Upon theſe conſiderations I ſhall diſcourſe firſt of the Church, and then of the Miniſtry.</p>

               <head>§ 2. <hi>Of the Church, its Name and Nature.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE word <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> is noted to ſignifie, 1. An Aſſembly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together by a Superior. 2. Any multitude gathered into one place. 3. According to the uſe of the holy Scripture, a certain multitude, that retain the Name, as well when they are a part, as when they are met together. An Aſſembly at large is called <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> but <hi>Appellativè;</hi> but they that are now ſo called by ſpecial appropriation of the word, are a Society ſtanding in a ſpecial Relation to God, as his devoted People; and that both when they are aſſembled, and when they are apart; and whether they be the Univerſal Society of Gods People, or the particular Societies that are the integral parts of the Univerſal.</p>
               <p>The word Church is the Engliſh of <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> in its appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſignification; and it is taken divers ways, but all agreeing in the aforeſaid Notion: 1. For the whole Company of Gods Elect, compriſing the uncalled, and the Militant, and the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. 2. For the whole Company of the faithful, both Militant and Triumphant, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. 3. For all profeſſors of the Faith of Chriſt, or viſible Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.1. 4. For the <hi>Catholick</hi> Viſible Church as a political Society, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. 5. For the particular Churches, parts of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64714:4"/>the Church Officers, and the people or Community of the faithful, as the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. and in many other places. 6. For the members of the Church or Community of the faithful, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from their ſpiritual Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.4, 22. 7. For the Governours of the Church, as diſtinct from the governed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18, 19. 8. For a Church-Aſſembly come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for Divine Worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.19, 34. 9. For the faithful in ſome one family, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Philem.</hi> 2. if it do not ſignifie a Church meeting in thoſe houſes. Theſe ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the word agree in the ſaid common Notion, of a number of People aſſociated in a peculiar and Spiritual Relation to God; yet the ſaid Notion is more noble and compleat in ſome of them, than in others.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe, there is the vulgar uſe of the Word, for the Houſe ſet a part for the Church to meet in for Gods Publick Worſhip. And no doubt but the Word may be lawfully ſo uſed; it being a trope in ordinary uſe, to put the name of the perſons contained, upon the place containing; as alſo, the name of the place containing, upon the perſons contained: But that there is any ſuch uſe of the word in Holy Scripture, to me is not evident. As for the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Have ye not houſes to eat and drink in? or, deſpiſe ye the Church of God;</hi> it ſeems not to me, to be inferred from it: For the Church of God there ſaid to be deſpiſed, may be underſtood rather of Gods People aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>

               <head>§ 3. <hi>The Church is a Society diſtinct from the Commonwealth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT hath been well noted, That there can be no greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of real diſtinction, than actual ſeparation. And the Church and Commonwealth are ſeparate; whereſoever there is a Chriſtian Church in a Commonwealth, that is not Chriſtian, indeed in that Caſe the Chriſtians taken perſonally, are members, not ſevered from the Commonwealth, but parts of it; but the Spiritual Society, which they make, is no part of it, but really ſevered from it.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64714:5"/>
               <p>When a Commonwealth becomes Chriſtian, the Church is not to be looked upon as ſwallowed up in the Commonwealth, but they remain diſtinct Societies, notwithſtanding the intimate conjunction that is between them; and they differ in their kind and formal ſtate from each other. The foundation upon which the Commonwealth reſts, and its conſtitutive parts formally taken, are of another nature than the foundation on which the Church reſts, and its conſtitutive parts formally taken. The former is immediately founded in humane Laws, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts, and Eſſentially made up of ſeveral orders and ranks of men diverſly indued with temporal qualifications, powers and liberties, joyned by Civil Bands, and Subordinate one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but the latter is immediately founded in Divine Laws, not only natural, but poſitive; and Eſſentially made up of ſeveral orders and ranks of men, ſpiritually diſtinguiſhed, and indued with ſpiritual qualifications, Powers and Liberties, joyned by Spiritual Bands, and Subordinate one to another. Hereupon none become Members of the Church, merely as Members of the Commonwealth; and none become <hi>Cives</hi> or Members of the Commonwealth, merely as Members of the Church; and they that are deprived of the Rights of the Commonwealth, may ſtill injoy the Priviledges of the Church; and they that are deprived of the Priviledges of the Church, may ſtill injoy the Rights of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Indeed a Chriſtian Commonwealth, ultimately intends thoſe high and excellent ends, which the Church doth nextly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, <hi>viz.</hi> The Glory of God, and the Eternal happineſs of men; and procures the ſame in its own way, as the Church doth in its way. And the Magiſtrates and Officers of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth muſt proceed by the Rules of Chriſtianity in their Civil Adminiſtrations, as well as the Miniſters of the Church in their Sacred Adminiſtrations; and they are the Servants of Chriſt the Mediator, not only as Chriſtians, but as Magiſtrates. And Chriſtianity doth influence its profeſſors, conſidered as Members of the Commonwealth, as well as of the Church.</p>
               <p>In theſe reſpects, ſuch a Commonwealth hath attained a more excellent State, and exiſts in a more perfect mode, than other Commonwealths. Nevertheleſs the Church is another and higher thing than that higher mode of the Commonwealth as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64714:5"/>and hath an Eſſentially different Polity, being a Society of another foundation, and ſpecifically different Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is queſtionable (to ſay the leaſt), whether the Civil Power of the Commonwealth, and the Spiritual Power of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, may lawfully reſide in the ſame perſon. I do not now ſpeak of that Power in the Church, which is objectively Eccleſiaſtical, but formally Civil, (ſuch as is the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in all Cauſes and over all Perſons Eccleſiaſtical, within his Dominions); but of Power formally Spiritual. And if both Spiritual and Civil Power, may lawfully reſide in the ſame perſon; yet that perſon, tho naturally but one, would be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litically two, and the People ſubordinate to him in thoſe two capacities; tho they be the ſame perſons, yet they would be two Societies diſtinguiſhed in their Eſſential forms.</p>
               <p>When the Commonwealth fails, the Church may ſtill ſubſiſt; and when the Church fails, the Commonwealth may ſtill ſubſiſt. The Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that was a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered an Interciſion during the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity; yet their Church then remained, tho it were greatly wounded, it was not extinct. And afterwards when they were no Commonwealth of themſelves, but a Province of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, their Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Society and Polity ſtood intire, till it was to give place to the Chriſtian Church.</p>

               <head>§ 4. <hi>Of the Church, as Viſible and Inviſible.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE notion of Viſible and Inviſible, muſt not here be taken ſtrictly for that which is, or is not the object of ſeeing only, but of other ſenſitive perception, or of any humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition. All other Societies of men admit not this diſtinction, becauſe they are conſtituted in their formal being, by things that do appear outwardly. But this of the Church is conſtituted in its formal being, <hi>primarily</hi> by things that in themſelves do not appear outwardly; and but <hi>ſecondarily</hi> by things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as expreſſions of the things that in themſelves appear not.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64714:6"/>
               <p>The Church is a Society of regenerate perſons joyned to the Lord Chriſt as their Head, and to one another as fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by a myſtical union, through the Holy Goſt reſiding in them all; and through faith unfeigned towards God in Chriſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love toward one another, juſtified, ſanctified and adopted to the inheritance of Eternal Glory. Now the ſaid Qualifications, Relations, and Priviledges being in themſelves hid from mens knowledg and judgment, do primarily conſtitute the Church, which is thereupon in its primary conſideration, a Society Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Inviſible.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a Society of perſons profeſſing Chriſtianity or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and externally joyned to Chriſt, and to one another by the profeſſion of unfeigned faith and love, and by the Symbols of that profeſſion, and partakers of the external Priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it: And according to this external Conſtitution, which is neceſſary, tho it be not primary, it is named Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>So then the Church Inviſible and Viſible, are not two Societies; but the ſame Society diſtinguiſhed by its divers formal conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and conſtitutions; the one <hi>primary,</hi> the other <hi>ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and the former is not for the latter, but the latter for the former.</p>
               <p>Theſe two diſtinct conſiderations, or modes or forms of the ſame Society, are not commenſurate to each other; but the Church in its Viſible form is of a larger extent than in its Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible form. For many profeſs Chriſtianity, or Dedication to God in Chriſt, that are not really, that is, heartily and intirely ſo dedicated.</p>
               <p>This Society, as underſtood in the compleat notion thereof, cannot be extended any further then its <hi>primary,</hi> that is, its Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible form doth reach. Whatſoever lies without that compaſs, is but the ſhadow without the ſubſtance, the image without the life thereof. And therefore all they that are joyned to it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to its Viſible form, are of it not adequately, univocally and ſimply, but inadequately, analogically, <hi>&amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that upon their credible profeſſion are of this Society but analogically, as to the external form only, have juſt Right and Title to its external Priviledges, according to their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſpoſedneſs, before them that can diſcern and directly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64714:6"/>judg only of things that appear outwardly; ſo that if men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar them of thoſe Priviledges, they do them wrong. For tho God allows them not, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Credible profeſſion, in whatſoever degree, higher or lower, can ground but a judgment of charity in a higher or lower degree, about ones part in this Society according to its Inviſible form; yet it can ground a judgment of certainty about ones part in the ſame according to its Viſible form. So that altho God only knows thoſe whom he accepts; yet the Church may know certainly whom ſhe ought to admit. And as God in the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his cognizance, to wit, the ſincerity of profeſſion, and the rights conſequent thereunto; ſo the Church in the matter belonging to its cognizance, to wit, the credibility of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the rights conſequent thereunto, proceeds upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg.</p>

               <p>IT hath been well obſerved, That the term <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, hath been ſometimes uſed of a particular Church holding the true Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and is the ſame with Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical; and in this ſence, any Biſhop of a true Apoſtolical Church, may be called a <hi>Catholick</hi> Biſhop. But here the term <hi>Catholick</hi> ſignifies the ſame with Oecumenical, or the Church that is throughout the whole World, or the whole World of Chriſtians. And in this ſence, the Church is termed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> not as actually extending to the whole World; but potentially, no Nation or People being excluded, but all having Liberty to accept and injoy the Priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>In this notion there is one <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, both in the Inviſible and Viſible form. The <hi>Catholick</hi> Church Inviſible, is the whole company of true Believers throughout the World, who make that part of Chriſts Myſtical Body, which ia mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64714:7"/>here on Earth. The <hi>Catholick</hi> Church Viſible, is the whole company of Viſible believers, throughout the World, or believers according to humane judgment.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is not only notionally, but really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent, and hath Relation to particular Churches, as an intregal whole, to integral parts. The ſame relation it hath alſo to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtians; yea, and to ſuch as are not fixed members of a particular Church.</p>
               <p>There being one peculiar Kingdom of Chriſt, throughout the World, diſtinct from the World in general, viſibly conſtituted and adminiſtred, not by humane Laws, and Coercive Power, as Secular Kingdoms are; but by Divine Laws and Power directly and purely reſpecting the conſcience, there muſt needs be one <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Viſible Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Catholick</hi> Church in its Viſible form, is one political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or Spiritual Commonwealth, the City of God, the more ſpecial Kingdom of Chriſt upon Earth; for the World in general is his Kingdom at large.</p>
               <p>The Unity of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church being a political Society, ariſeth not out of a local contiguity, but out of the moral and political Union of the parts.</p>
               <p>And if the Inviſible Church be one body, the Viſible muſt be ſo likewiſe. For theſe terms, the Church Viſible and Inviſible, do not ſignifie two Societies (as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed); but the ſame Society diſtinguiſhed by its diver conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Viſible <hi>Catholick</hi> Church hath one Head and Supreme Lord, even Chriſt; one Charter and Syſteme of Laws, Members that are free denizons of the whole Society, one form of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or ſolemn initiation for all its Members; one Spiritual polity, or one Divine form of Government, and one kind of Eccleſiaſtical Power.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64714:7"/>
               <p>The members of one particular Church are intituled to the priviledges granted of God to viſible Chriſtians in any other Church whereſoever they come to be injoyed by them according to their capacity, and in a due order: And whereſoever any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian comes as a ſtranger, he is by his relation to the Univerſal Church, bound to have communion with the particular Church or Churches of that place in Gods ordinances, according to his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and opportunity. And if it be ſaid, he is looked upon as a tranſient member of that particular Church, where he comes as a ſtranger: I anſwer, that it ariſeth from his being a member of the Catholick Church, which contains all particular Churches, as an integral whole, its ſeveral parts; for it is his right, and not a favour or a matter of mere charity.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever is juſtly and orderly caſt out of one Church, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vertually caſt out of all Churches, and ought to be received by none. This cannot be meerly by compact among the Churches, or by the mutual relation of mere concordant or ſiſter Churches, but by their being integral parts of one ſociety, for the ejection out of all <hi>(de jure)</hi> follows naturally, neceſſarily, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection out of one.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles were general officers of the whole Catholick Church as of one viſible ſociety: And it is not to be imagined, that it loſt its unity by their death. The ordinary Paſtors and Teachers, tho actually and in exerciſe overſeeing their own parts, are habitually and radically related to the whole Catholick Church, and thereby are inabled to exerciſe their miniſterial authority in any other parts, whereſoever they come, without a new ordination, or receiving a new paſtoral authority, ſo that they do it in a due order. This ſhews that the ſeveral Churches are parts of one politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſociety, otherwiſe the officers could not act authoritatively out of their own particular congregation, no more than (as one well obſerves) a Mayor or Conſtable can exerciſe their offices in other Corporations.</p>

               <p>THE Catholick Church is not (as ſecular Kingdoms or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths are) autonomical, that is, having within it ſelf that Power of its own fundamental conſtitution, and of the laws and officers and adminiſtrations belonging to it, as a Church or ſpiritual polity; but it hath received all theſe from Chriſt, its Head, King and Law giver.

               <p>The ſpiritual authority ſeated in the Church, is not ſeated in the Church, as Catholick, ſo as to deſcend from it by way of derivation and communication to particular Churches; but it is immediately ſeated in the ſeveral particular Churches as ſimilar parts of one political Body the Church Catholick.</p>
               <p>The Church Catholick is as one univerſal or Oecumenical Kingdom, having one ſupream Lord, one Body of Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BY Headſhip over the Church in this inquiry, is not meant a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Deſporick power over it; for the Church hath no Lord but Chriſt, nor ſoveraign authority over it, which is the power of legiſlation and final deciſive judgment, by which men ſtand or fall finally; for the Church hath no King but Chriſt. I exclude Headſhip in any ſuch ſence, as not fit to come under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>But the Query is, Whether a general Council be ſupream in that kind of power which reſides in the Church, and is only miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and diſpenſatory? that is, whether it hath a ſupream miniſtry or Geconomy over the Catholick Church, ſo that all Churches and miniſters have their power conveyed to them from the ſame, not as from the Fountain (which is Chriſt alone) but as from the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64714:9"/>thereof, and are ſubject to its authoritative regulation and determinations, and finally accountable to it for their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
               <p>Who can affirm that an Oecumenical council rightly ſo named, was ever in being? The councils that have born that name, were conventions of Biſhops within the Roman Empire, except ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few that were without it, and thoſe living near the confines of it. Whereupon let it be conſidered, whether the ſaid councils were truly Oecumenical, or juſt repreſentatives of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>That which is wont to be ſaid for the affirmative is, that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were excluded from the right of voting therein, but from all parts of the world they might come to them as rightful members of them, if they would.</p>
               <p>But what if no greater number of Biſhops meet upon a ſummons to a General council, than did at the council of <hi>Trent?</hi> May ſuch a convention be called an Oecumenical council becauſe all might come that would, when ſo ſmall a number came as was comparatively no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the number of biſhops throughout the world? Or can the convention of a greater number, ſuppoſe as many as met in the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> council, be juſtly called a repreſentative of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or carry the ſence of it, when it bears no more proportion to it? Surely it is not their freedom of acceſs, but their actual convening at leaſt, in a proportionable number, that can juſtly give the denomination.</p>
               <p>And what if the biſhops without the limits of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire would not come to a General council called by the Mandate of the Roman Emperour, eſpecially they that lived in the remoter parts, as <hi>Ethiopia and India,</hi> &amp;c?

               <p>Tho the moſt illuſtrious part of the Catholick Church was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Roman Empire, yet an aſſembly of the biſhops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could no more make a repreſentative of the Catholick Church, than an aſſembly of the biſhops of the other part of the world without them could have done, if there had been ſuch an aſſembly.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64714:10"/>
               <p>Beſides the ancient General councils were uſually called in the Eaſtern parts of the Empire; and tho the biſhops of thoſe parts might convene in a conſiderable number, yet the number from the Weſtern parts was inconſiderable, and as none, comparatively to a juſt proportion. Let it be hereupon conſidered, whether the ſaid councils were a juſt repreſentative, and did carry the ſence of that part of the Catholick Church that was included in that Empire. And in this conſideration it is not of little moment to obſerve what numbers of biſhops were ordinarily congregated in the many provincial aſſemblies, and that within provinces of narrower circuits of ground.</p>
               <p>And how doth it appear that an Oecumenical council, rightly ſo named, can be? For ſuppoſe it be not neceſſary to conſiſt of all the biſhops in the world, but of ſome as delegates in the name of all, yet it muſt conſiſt of ſo many proportionably delegated from all in the ſeveral quarters, as may ſignifie the ſence and conſent of all.</p>
               <p>Hereupon let it be conſidered, whether there be a poſſibility of ſuch aſſemblies; much more whether there be a poſſibility of the continuation, or of the ſucceſſion of them in ſuch frequency as would be requiſite in caſe ſuch an aſſembly were Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>Nor doth it ſtand with reaſon, that an Oecumenical council, in caſe it were exiſtent, can poſſibly execute the authority that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the head of the Univerſal Church, in overſeeing all, in receiving appeals from all, in making authoritative determinations for all, either immediately by it ſelf, or mediately by ſubordinate councils, judicatories, and miniſters, to be ſuperintended, regulated and determined by it in their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any notice given of the ſaid headſhip of a General council, more than of the Popes or any other biſhops univerſal headſhip in the primitive and authentick records of the Charter that Chriſt hath given to his Church, to wit, the Holy Scriptures: Nor is any rule given therein for the conſtitution of a General coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, whether it ſhall be made up only of the Clergy, or only of ſuch biſhops as are of a higher order th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d accidentals of Religion? Now the church remaining ſuch, is not neceſſarily or in its nature infallible ſo far, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be infallible, it muſt be ſo from the free grant of Chriſt; But it doth not appear in the Holy Scripture that any ſuch grant is made to the church.</p>
               <p>What was the Apoſtles doctrine, and conſequently the doctrine of the Church in their days, obedient to their authority, we know; what the church univerſally held in any one age touching all the integral parts of religion, much more concerning accidentals, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive extreamly difficult, if not impoſſible to be known. But that the church hath <hi>de facto,</hi> if not univerſally, yet very generally erred in the ſame errour about ſome integrals of religion, appears by the ancient general practiſe of ſome things, now generally accounted erroneous; as for inſtance, the giving of the Lords Supper to infants.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64714:11"/>
               <p>Moreover it is evident, that the whole Church in its ſeveral parts hath erred, ſome in one point, ſome in another; and that no part thereof hath been found in which hath appeared no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in ſome point of Religion or other. And if all the parts may variouſly err in ſeveral points, why may not they alſo harmoniouſly err all of them in one and the ſame point?</p>
               <p>If the Catholick Church be not infallible in all doctrines of Faith, much leſs is any ſuch Council infallible as was ever yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated, or is ever like to be congregated.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it follows, that in all Controverſies of doctrine we cannot ſtand finally to the deciſion of the Catholick Church, if it were poſſible to be had; or to the deciſion of any the largeſt Council that can poſſibly convene.</p>
               <p>We cannot tell what the Catholick Church is, nor what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches or perſons are ſound parts thereof, but by the holy Scriptures. For what <hi>Criterion</hi> can be brought beſides them? Mens bare teſtimony of themſelves is not to be reſted on. How can we know that the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was orthodox in its determination about the Sacred Trinity, and the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council erroneous in its determination for Image-worſhip, but by finding that the former was conſonant, and the latter diſſonant to the Scripture in their aforeſaid determinations?</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, That of Councils called General, thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of greater numbers of biſhops muſt carry it againſt thoſe that conſiſt of leſſer numbers; let ſome proof either from Scripture or Reaſon be given for it. What ground is there from either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in the time of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie the major part of biſhops in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or the major part of thoſe that aſſembled in Council, and for inſtance in the firſt Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> might not poſſibly have been <hi>Arrians?</hi> Moreover if the major part were to carry it in the firſt ſix Centuries, why not alſo in the ten laſt?</p>
               <p>That promiſe of Chriſt, Mat. 28. <hi>I am with you always to the end of the world,</hi> may imply, That there ſhall be a ſucceſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of Biſhops or Paſtors in the Catholick Church to the worlds end, that ſhall be Orthodox in the Eſſentials, yea and in the Integrals of Religion; yet it doth not imply that they ſhall be the greater number of thoſe that are called and reputed biſhops or paſtors within Chriſtendom, nor that the greater number of thoſe being convened in Councils, ſhall not err in their Conciliar determinations about matters of Faith.</p>

               </head>
               <p>CHRIST hath promiſed the perpetuity of the Church in general, in ſaying that he would build it on a Rock, and the gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt it; and <hi>I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the end of the world;</hi> but how far, and in what reſpect this perpetuity and indefectibility is promiſed, ought to be enquired into, leſt we expect or inſiſt upon more than the promiſe hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</p>
               <p>That which Chriſt hath promiſed, cannot be leſs, than that there be always upon earth a number of true believers, or faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, made viſible by their external profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſucceſſively continued till the end of all things.</p>
               <p>It is alſo aſcertained, that there ſhall be at leaſt the eſſentials of a Church-ſtate, or Church organical (as ſome expreſs it) conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a part governing, and a part governed, always continued ſomewhere upon earth. For Chriſts promiſe is to be with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the executing of their Miniſtry, always, to the end of the world; and it muſt be underſtood of them not barely conſidered, as perſons; but as his commiſſioned Officers, including their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, not in the Apoſtolical and Temporary, but in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and perpetual Authority, which they had in common with Paſtors, Biſhops or Presbyters. And <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. ſhews, that the Miniſtry is to endure till the whole Myſtical body of Chriſt be compleated.</p>
               <p>But the promiſe doth not import, that any particular Church, or any particular combination of Churches in one frame of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Polity, how ample or illuſtrious ſoever, ſhall be perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of Paſtors, and ſecured from a total defection and rejection either from a Church ſtate, or from Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If any particular church, or any one larger part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick church, hath been preſerved from the Apoſtles days till now, when others have been extinct, it is by the good pleaſure of God, whoſe ways and counſels are wiſe and holy, yet unſearchable and paſt finding out.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64714:12"/>
               <p>Nor doth the promiſe import, that the true church ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually conſpicuous, tho it be perpetually viſible: for in ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it may be more obſcure, in others more apparent. It is granted by that party that much inſiſts upon the conſpicuouſneſs of their church, as a city on a hill, That in the time of Antichriſt the church ſhall ſcarcely be diſcerned. Now in ſuch a ſtate it may be ſaid to be, tho not abſolutely, yet comparatively inviſible, that is, being compared with what it is when more conſpicuouſly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>Nor doth it import that any particular church, or any moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and illuſtrious part of the Catholick church, ſhall perpetually abide in the Apoſtolick purity of doctrine, worſhip, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that it may depart from it, and fall into moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous errors and practiſes in the ſaid points, and yet may not loſe the eſſentials of Chriſtian doctrine, and church-ſtate. The Scripture foretels of a great falling away, and a laſting defection in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church, and a long continued predominancy of an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate therein.</p>
               <p>Nay, for ought can be cogently inferred from the aforeſaid promiſe, the ſaid defection might have been ſo univerſal, as to leave no part of the Catholick church divided from the Apoſtatical or Antichriſtian ſtate and party, by a different external church-polity; but the ſound and ſincere part of the Church may truckle under it and be included in its external frame; and keep themſelves from being deſtroyed by it, ſome of them diſcerning and ſhunning the bainful doctrine and practiſe; and others that are infected with it, holding the truth predominantly in their hearts and lives, and ſo tho not ſpeculatively yet practically prevailing againſt the wicked errours.</p>
               <p>If in all times there have been ſome ſocieties of Chriſtians that did not fall away in the great defection, nor incorporate with the antichriſtian ſtate; but were by themſelves in a ſevered church-ſtate; yet Chriſt hath not promiſed that there ſhall be notice thereof throughout all Chriſtendom in the times when the ſaid ſocieties were in being, nor that hiſtories ſhould be written thereof for the knowledg of after ages.</p>
               <p>Howbeit we have ſufficient notice by credible hiſtory, that there have been many ample chriſtian churches throughout all ages that were not incorporated with the antichriſtian ſtate, and that did diſſent from their great enormities in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64714:12"/>alſo that many Worthies living in the midſt of that great apoſtacy, did during the whole time thereof ſucceſſively bear witneſs for the truth againſt it, and that for a great part of the time huge multitudes alſo living in the midſt of the ſaid apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſeparated from it, and were embodied into churches of another conſtitution more conformable to the Primitive Chriſtianity.</p>

               <p>Whether to be embodied or aſſociated for perſonal commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in worſhip, and for perſonal ſuperintendency of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors over all the members, be the true formal or eſſential conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of particular churches by divine right, I leave to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>ORdinarily the place of a particular church was a City, and from the City the church ordinarily took its denomination. Nevertheleſs, nothing is found in Scripture to make a City the only proper Manſion of a church, ſo that no Village could be a fit Receptacle of it; yea, the Scripture mentions a church which was not a City-church, <hi>viz</hi> that at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> which was not a City, but the Haven of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cities being places of the confluence of people, had ordinarily the Goſpel firſt preached, and firſt received in them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently firſt afforded the materials of a church. And they were the fitteſt places for the erection of a church in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of more converts to be added to them, beſides other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. And therefore right Reaſon, without a particular Divine command, would direct thoſe Maſter-builders the Apoſtles to erect churches in cities.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the City-churches were not confined to the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive cities, but commonly took in all the Chriſtians of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Villages. And in the Apoſtles times the Chriſtians both of a city and its adjacent Villages, did ordinarily but make up one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent congregation, or in its numbers it did not exceed one of our pariſhes. Tho ſome very few churches quickly grew numerous, yet moſt rationally it may be conceived, that they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed many, nor equal ſome of our very populous Pariſhes.</p>

               <p>AS Cities in a Kingdom, ſo are particular churches in the church univerſal. This ſimilitude holds in the main, but not in all reſpects. As a whole Kingdom hath its fundamental Conſtitution by which it ſubſiſts, and its <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges belonging to the whole; ſo the church univerſal hath its fundamental conſtitution and charter by which it ſubſiſts in its proper ſtate. And as every city is a diſtinct body-politick under the King, and hath from him its charter by which it ſubſiſts; ſo every particular church as a diſtinct political Society under Chriſt, hath its charter from him, by which it ſubſiſts in its proper ſtate.</p>
               <p>The erecting of particular churches as ſeveral political ſocieties by the Apoſtles, who were Chriſts authorized Agents for erecting his ſpecial Kingdom the church, and guided therein by his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, and by others at their direction, and according to the ſame Rule, is a ſufficient Charter for the conſtitution of ſuch chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wherever there are fit materials. Beſides, the law of nature requires the parcelling the church univerſal into ſuch diſtinct So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties under their proper Paſtors, that church-communion and Paſtoral ſuperintendency might not be tranſient and uncertain, but permanent and certain.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral cities in the ſame Kingdom may have their ſpecial Laws and Priviledges divers from each other, according to the diverſity of their charters granted by the King. But particular churches have not municipal laws and priviledges divers from each other, but the ſame in common to them all, becauſe they have all the ſame charter <hi>in ſpecie.</hi> Here note, that they may be rightly called diſtinct Political Societies, that have each of them their own charter, tho it be not divers, but the ſame in kind among them all.</p>
               <p>He that is a citizen or a Magiſtrate of one city, is not a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Magiſtrate, or Officer in all cities of the ſame Kingdom. But a member or a Paſtor of one particular church, hath an habitual or fundamental Right of being a member or Paſtor in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church throughout the world, which is not actually to be

               <p>Particular churches, tho they conſiſt of diſſimilar parts, are all of them ſimilar parts of the Church Catholick, partaking of its name and nature, whereas cities are diſſimilar parts of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>From theſe premiſes it follows, that the qualifications requiſite to make men members or miniſters of the univerſal church, do ſufficiently qualifie them to be members or miniſters of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church wherewith they are naturally capable of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

               <p>ALL the Chriſtians in the world are one holy ſociety; and if it were poſſible they ſhould have local preſential communion one with another; but that being impoſſible by reaſon of the large extent of the ſociety, they are neceſſarily parcelled into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral congregations; for the capacity of ſuch communion is the end of erecting particular churches; in all reaſon they ſhould conſiſt of perſons, who by their cohabitation in a vicinity are made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, and there may not be a greater local diſtance of the perſons from each other than can ſtand with it.</p>
               <p>Moreover all Chriſtians of the ſame local precinct, not more populous nor of larger extent than to allow perſonal communion, are moſt conveniently brought into one and the ſame ſtated church, that there might be the greateſt union among them, and that the occaſion of ſtraggling and running into ſevered parties might be avoided.

               <p>It is ſuppoſed by ſome learned men, that in the Apoſtles time there were ſeveral Churches at <hi>Rome</hi> under their ſeveral biſhops or paſtors, as one of the circumciſion, another of the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion within the ſame local precincts.

               <head>§ 19. <hi>The ſubordination of Churches of the ſame kind, conſidered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TOuching this point of the ſubordination of Churches, there be three parts of the enquiry. 1. Whether there be a ſubordination of one or more particular Churches to another particular Church whoſe conſtitution and frame is the ſame <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> with theirs? 2. Whether there be a ſubordination of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches to ſome other Church ſpecifically different from them in the frame thereof, and being in a ſtate of greater ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and amplitude? 3. Whether there be a ſubordination of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches taken diſtributively, to an aſſociation or collective body of the ſame Churches, or an aſſembly thereof; and of that collective body to a larger aſſociation of more ſuch collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies conjunct with it, or to an aſſembly thereof, and ſo forward till we come to the largeſt that can be reached unto?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether there be a ſubordination of one or more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches to another particular Church, whoſe conſtitution and frame is the ſame <hi>in ſpecie</hi> with theirs, and whoſe officers are of the ſame holy order, ſuch as the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were in relation one to another, and as congregational Churches are to each other, and as Dioceſan Churches are to each other, if <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> there be ſuch Churches? Now as touching ſubordination in this kind, what hath been or may be by humane right upon prudential conſiderations either ſtatedly or <hi>pro tempore,</hi> is not here examined; but what is by divine right inferring an obligation upon one Church to be ſubject to another of the ſame ſpecifick frame with it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a Church hath been called a mother-Church in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other churches, either becauſe they have iſſued from it, as ſwarms from a hive, or becauſe they have received the Chriſtian faith from it, or becauſe they have been erected by ſome ſent forth from it, &amp;c. Now that theſe latter Churches do owe a reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial regard and obſervance to the firſt, which is called the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church, is not to be doubted; and ſuch regard or obſervance every ſmall or obſcure Church owes to thoſe that are more Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Illuſtrious or Renowned.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64714:16"/>
               <p>But that the ſaid Mother. Church can by divine right or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant claim a governing power over thoſe Churches that have iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it; or that the more Ample and Illuſtrious Churches can claim the like over the ſmaller and obſcurer, I do not find any proof; but I judg the contrary, becauſe, notwithſtanding the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid diverſity or diſparity of condition, they all reſt upon the ſame Baſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Chriſts Charter, by which they are conſtituted, which is the ſame to all, and alike immediately given to all. So that in this reſpect they all ſtand upon the ſame level, and are equal. Now one equal hath not governing power over another in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are both equal.</p>

               <head>§ 20. <hi>The ſubordination of Churches of different kinds, conſidered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS touching the ſubordination of Churches to ſome other Church ſpecifically different from them, as of parochial or congregational Churches to a Dioceſan, Provincial, National Church; be it firſt obſerved, that the Dioceſan Church is not merely the incorporated ſociety of a Cathedral, nor any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, beſides the Parochial Churches; nor is it material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divers from them jointly taken; nor the provincial church from the Dioceſan churches; nor the national church from the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial churches jointly taken: But in their ſeveral ranks they differ formally, as being each of them one body politick conſtituted by the political compages of the churches included in each of them.</p>
               <p>And let what was before obſerved be here reminded, that each congregational or parochial church, having its proper Presbyter or Elder inveſted with the power of the keys, is a political church, or ſuch as hath its government within it ſelf. And thereupon the divine warrant of ſuch a Dioceſan Church as is the loweſt that hath government within it ſelf, and conſequently that ſwallows hundreds of political churches that are of Chriſts inſtitution, was called in queſtion, and ſtill I deſire the Aſſerters of it to give ſome proof of its divine right.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Poſtſcript of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> mentions him as ordained the firſt biſhop of the <hi>Cretians.</hi> Of what authority that Poſtſcript is, I know not; but this is certain, that where there
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64714:16"/>were Chriſtians, there were to be churches in every city of <hi>Crete,</hi> and there were reckoned a hundred cities in that no very large Iſland, and thoſe churches were political ſocieties within themſelves having their proper elders or biſhops. And upon ſuppoſition that the whole Iſland made but one larger church conſtituted by the political union of the ſaid particular churches in every city under <hi>Titus,</hi> it muſt be ſuch as is now called a provincial church under one Archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>Now if the Dioceſan church be not looked upon as the Ioweſt political church, but as conſtituted by the political union of congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational or parochial churches, held alſo to be political, under an officer of another order, and the proper ſuperior of thoſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, under which the parochial churches immediately are, then let it be obſerved, that a church of this frame is not properly an Epiſcopal but an Archiepiſcopal Church. For the churches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is compacted are properly Epiſcopal, being ſuch as have each of them their own biſhop, paſtor or elder. But the divine right of ſuch an Archiepiſcopal church, I leave to further inquiry.</p>
               <p>As for a National church, I come now to inquire in what ſence it may or may not be granted. In a more general notion it is ſome part of the univerſal church diſtinguiſhed and ſevered from the reſt of that body, by the limits of a Nation, or of a civil ſtate; or in other terms, a nation of Chriſtian churches, or the Chriſtian churches of a Nation.</p>
               <p>But there are more expreſs and ſpecial notions thereof reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frame of Eccleſiaſtical Polity, which are diſcrepant from each other: And about the being thereof in theſe ſpecial notions, mens judgments vary. Some own a national church in this ſence only: viz. a nation of churches, or the churches of a nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, at leaſt in the eſſentials of chriſtian Dectrine, divine Worſhip, and church-Government. Some own a national church in a ſtricter ſenſe, namely, the ſaid churches not only agreeing in the points aforeſaid, but politically united by the ſame common band of Eccleſiaſtical Government under one head perſonal or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective. And this ſtricter ſence hath a ſubdiviſion; for it may be underſtood of the churches united in a Civil Eccleſiaſtical polity, under a civil head or ſupream, or of the churches embodyed in the band of a polity purely Eccleſiaſtical under a ſpiritual head or ſupream.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64714:17"/>
               <p>I own the rightful being and divine warrant of a national church as united in one Civil Eccleſiaſtical polity under one civil head or ſupream, either perſonal as in a Monarchy, or collective as in a Republick. And in this ſence I aſſent to the National Church of <hi>England:</hi> viz. All the churches in <hi>England</hi> politically united under one Supream Civil Church-Governour, the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
               <p>Yet it is to be underſtood, that the partition of a church by the bounds of a nation or of a civil ſtate, is but extrinſecal or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the church as ſuch; alſo that the union of the churches of a nation in the band of civil church-polity under a civil head, is but an extrinſecal, and not an intrinſecal union.</p>
               <p>But I queſtion the divine warrant of a national church embodied in the band of one national polity purely Eccleſiaſtical under one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual head or ſupream, either Perſonal as a Primate or Patriarch, or collective as a conſiſtory of biſhops or elders intrinſecally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, and being a conſtitutive part of it: For I find no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non or Precedent for it in Scripture, which is the adequate rule of divine right in the frame of churches, and of what intrinſecally belongs thereuntò, and I do not know any ſuch ſpiritual head of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> as for the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> they at the moſt can be heads but of their reſpective provinces, and are not ſubordinate but coordinate to each other in point of Archiepiſcopal Government, however the caſe is between them in point of precedency.</p>
               <p>Yet if the civil ſupream power ſhall conſtitute a perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Eccleſiaſtical to be head of a national church, or the churches of a nation politically imbodied, I here offer nothing againſt it, or for it; But if there be ſuch a national conſtitution, being but humane, it is but extrinſecal and accidental to the church; and being derived from the civil ſupream, it is but a civil church-poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Come to enquire whether there be a ſubordination of churches, taken diſtributively to an aſſociation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>The aſſociation of particular churches is of the law of nature, and therefore to be put in practiſe according to their capacity, tho there were no poſitive law for it; for they are all ſo many diſtinct members of one great body, or integral parts of the Catholick church; and they are all concerned in each others well being, both in reference to themſelves as fellow members of one body, and to Chriſt their Head, whoſe honour and intereſt they muſt promote, each church not only within themſelves, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the churches to the utmoſt extent of their agency: And they naturally ſtand in need of each others help in things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them ſeverally and jointly.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that there be greater and leſſer aſſociations acting in their ſeveral ſpheres higher or lower, the one included in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is of the law of nature, or of natural convenience for the more ample capacity and more orderly contributing of the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al help aforeſad; ſuch as have been called claſſical, provincial and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſemblies uſed in one form of church-government; yea, and beyond this the aſſociation of the churches of many nations as far towards an oecumenical council, as they are capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, is of the ſame reaſon: But of an oecumenical aſſociation truly ſo called, that is, of all the churches in the world, the moral impoſſibility thereof hath been ſpoken of before.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64714:18"/>
               <p>It is alſo by the law of nature moſt convenienient that in the leſſer aſſociations all the ruling officers perſonally meet; and that in the larger they meet by their delegates or repreſentatives choſen by all, and ſent in the name of all, which meetings are called aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies or ſynods; and the convenience of meeting by delegates is, that the particular churches be not for a time left wholly deſtitute of their guides, and that there may be leſs trouble and difficulty and danger of diſorder in the whole management. Note, That what is moſt naturally convenient, hath in it the reaſon of neceſſary, or is matter of duty, unleſs when ſomething gainſay or hinder, and then indeed it ceaſeth to be convenient.</p>
               <p>And that there be ſome kind of ſubordination in the ſaid aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and their reſpective Aſſemblies, is of the Law of nature, which requires order; but as to the kind or manner of ſubordination, men go ſeveral ways: Some place it in a proper Authority or Governing power that the collective bodies of Churches have over the ſeveral Churches included in them: others place it in the agreement of the ſeveral churches; and ſome of theſe make this further explanation, that the Canons made by Synods, as they are made for the people, who are ſubject to the Paſtors, are a ſort of Laws, and oblige by the Authority of the Paſtors; but as they are made for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or abſent Paſtors, who are ſeparately of equal Office, Power, they are no Laws except in an equivocal ſenſe, but only Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now in judging between theſe two ways of the ſubordination enquired of, let it be conſidered, firſt, That every particular church hath power of government within it ſelf, as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved. 2. That a particular church doth not derive that power from any other particular church, or collective body of churches, but hath it immediately from Chriſt. 3. That yet the acts of government in every particular church, have an influence into all the churches, being but integral parts of one whole, the Catholick church; and conſequently they are all of them nearly concerned in one another, as members of the ſame body. 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that particular churches combine in ſuch collective bodies and aſſociations as have been before mentioned, is not arbitrary, but their duty. 5. That the greater collective bodies are, in degrees more auguſt and venerable than the leſſer included in them; and in that regard ought to have ſway with the leſſer, and not meerly in regard of agreement: For tho in the greater there be but the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64714:18"/>ſame power <hi>in ſpecie</hi> with that in the leſſer; yet it is more amply and illuſtriouſly exerted. 6. That in all Societies every part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordered for the good of the whole, and the more ample and comprehenſive parts coming nearer to the nature and reaſon of the whole, than the leſſer and comprehended; the more ample parts if they have not a proper governing power over the leſſer, have at leaſt a preeminence over them for the ends ſake; and this preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence hath the force of a proper ſuperior power in bearing ſway. 7. Hence it follows, that the acts of Synods, if they be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly acts of government over the particular Paſtors, yet they have the efficacy of government, as being to be ſubmitted to for the ends ſake, The general good.</p>

               <p>WE muſt diſtinguiſh between things that belong to the church as a church, or a Society divers in kind from all other Societies; and thoſe things that belong to it extrinſecally, &amp; upon a reaſon common to it with other regular ſocieties. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wholly reſt upon Divine Right; the latter are <hi>in genere</hi> requiſite by the Law of Nature, which requires decency and order, and whatſoever is convenient in all ſocieties; and ſo far they reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Divine Right; but <hi>in ſpecie</hi> they are left to human determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the general Rules given of God in Nature or Scripture. And it is to be noted, That ſuch is the ſulneſs of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that it contains all the general Rules of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>What ſoever in matter of Church government doth go to the formal conſtitution of a church of Chriſt, is of Divine Right.</p>
               <p>The frame of the Church catholick as one ſpiritual ſociety un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt the head (as before deſcribed) wholly reſts upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right; and ſo the frame of particular churches as ſeveral ſpiritual Polities and integral parts of the Catholick church (as before deſcribed) is alſo of Divine Right, if ſuch Right be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſignified by the Precepts and Rules given by the Apoſtles for the framing of them, and by their practiſe therein. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the parcelling of that one great Society the Church-catholick
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64714:19"/>into particular Political Societies under their proper ſpiritual Guides and Rulers, is ſo neceſſary in nature to the good of the whole, that the Law of Nature hath made it unalterable.</p>
               <p>It is intrinſick to all particular ſtated Churches, and ſo of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, that there be publick Aſſemblies thereof for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip of God; that there be Biſhops, Elders, or ſpiritual Paſtors therein, and that theſe as Chriſts Officers guide the ſaid Aſſemblies in publick Worſhip, that therein they authoritatively preach the Word, and in Chriſts Name offer the mercies of the Goſpel upon his terms, and denounce the threatnings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel againſt thoſe that deſpiſe the mercies thereof; that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence the Sacraments to the meet partakers, and the ſpiritual cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon thoſe that juſtly fall under them; that the members of theſe Societies explicitely or implicitely conſent to their relation to their Paſtors, and one towards another. It doth alſo intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally belong to particular churches as they are integral parts of one Catholick church (of which all the particular Chriſtians contained in them are members) and conſequently it appears to be of Divine Right, that they hold communion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that they be imbodied according to their capacities in ſuch Aſſociations as have been before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>As for all circumſtantial variation, and accidental modification of the things aforeſaid, with reſpect to meer decency, order, and convenience, according to time and occaſion, being extrinſick to the ſpiritual frame and Polity of the Church as ſuch, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in common to it with all orderly Societies, they are of Divine Right only <hi>in genere,</hi> but <hi>in ſpecie</hi> they are left to thoſe to whom the conduct and government of the church is committed, to be determined according to the general Rules of Gods word.</p>
               <p>Much of the controverſie of this Age about ſeveral forms of Church-government, is about things extrinſick to the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and but accidental modes thereof, tho the ſeveral parties in the controverſie make thoſe Forms to which they adhere to be of Divine Right, and neceſſary to a Church-ſtate, or (as ſome ſpeak) a Church-organical. Now in the ſaid controverted Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there may be a great difference: for ſome may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the divine and conſtitutive frame of the Church, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to its ends; others may be incongruous to it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to its ends.</p>

               <p>MANY notes of a true Church are contentiouſly brought in by thoſe that would darken the truth by words without knowledg.

               <p>The more of the aforeſaid Conformity is ſound in any Church, the more true and ſound it is; and the leſs of it is found in any church, the more corrupt and falſe it is, and the more it declines from truth and ſoundneſs.</p>
               <p>A Church may bear ſo much conformity to its Rule, as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the real being, or eſſential ſtate of a Chriſtian church, and yet withall bear ſuch diſconformity to its Rule, as renders it very enormous.</p>
               <p>A church holding all the eſſentials of Faith, Worſhip, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Government, together with the addition of ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip, Miniſtry and Government, as is by conſequence a denial of thoſe eſſentials, and a ſubverting of the foundation, is a true church as to the eſſentials, tho very enormous and dangerous.

               <p>The ſame church may be a true and a falſe church in different reſpects, or formal conſiderations: In reſpect of the eſſentials of Chriſtian Faith, Worſhip and Miniſtry, it may be a true church; and in reſpect of ſome deviſed Church-form ſuperadded, by which over and above the ſaid Eſſentials it is conſtituted and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it may be in that diſtinct formal conſideration a falſe church.</p>

               <p>THE Holy Miniſtry is a ſtate of Authority and Obligation to perform ſome ſpecial Holy Works and Services in the Name of Chriſt for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the church: So that whoſoever is in a holy order or office, is <hi>qua talis</hi> authorized and obliged to the work and ſervice that is appropriated to it; and whoſoever ſtatedly and <hi>de jure</hi> doth the work and ſervice appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to a holy order, is really in or of that order, altho men may not give him the name thereof.</p>
               <p>Whether the Magiſtratical and Miniſterial Offices may reſide together in the ſame perſon, is not here conſidered; but if it were granted that they may, they would eſſentially differ from each other: For the Magiſtrate as ſuch hath received no authority formally miniſterial; nor hath any miniſter as ſuch the power of a civil magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Some thus diſtinguiſh between the magiſtratical and miniſterial authority, that the one is directive, and the other imperative. I take not this to be a competent diſtinction; for that authority that infers an obligation on the ſubject to obey, is properly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative, and the miniſterial authority doth ſo; as the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Paul</hi> was no Magiſtrate, but as a Miniſter he ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. Having in readineſs to revenge all diſobedience; and he expreſly declares his miniſterial authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Whoſoever doth by ſpecial office direct unto du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the name of his King, and according to his will (as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter doth in the name of Chriſt) doth therein command. But a coactive power is ſomething more and belongs not to a Miniſter as ſuch. The Magiſtrate rules by the Sword, and the Miniſter by the Word.</p>

               <p>But the circumſtances and accidental modes, and ſubſervient of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices about the work of the miniſtry are of that nature, as that they well may be appointed by men; and accordingly the officers for the management thereof may be ſo appointed: and ſuch modes and circumſtances being neceſſarily ſubject to great variation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great diverſity of occaſion, cannot well be pre-defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>The holy miniſtry and power belonging to it, is conferred nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Magiſtrate, nor by Prelate, nor by any ſpiritual officer or officers as the proper givers thereof, but by Chriſt alone: And tho Chriſt give it in ſome reſpect by the mediation of men, yet not by them as giving the office power, but as inſtruments either of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64714:21"/>deſigning the perſon to whom he gives it, or of the ſolemn inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that perſon therein; as the King is the immediate giver of the power of a Mayor in a Town corporate, when he gives it by the mediation of the Electors, not as giving the power, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the perſon to be inveſted with it, or by the mediation of ſome other officers as inſtruments of the ſolemn inveſtiture.</p>
               <p>Neither Magiſtrate nor Prelate, nor any ſpiritual officer or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers can dſiannul or take away that ſpiritual office, whereof they are not the authors, nor in proper ſence the givers. Nor can they inlarge or leſſen it as to its eſſential ſtate, or define it otherwiſe than Chriſt hath defined it: And if the ordainer in conveying the holy office or order ſhould uſe any any words or actions that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the leſſening thereof in its eſſential ſtate, they are void and null; as if a Miniſter that joyns a Man and Woman in marriage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intent of that ordinance, ſhall add ſome words that forbid the Husband the government of his Wife, that addition is a nullity.</p>

               <head>§ 3. <hi>Of the Office of a Biſhop, Elder, or Paſtor.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Miniſtry of Gods appointment is either extraordinary and temporary, as that of the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts alſo, if ſo be they were only the itinerary aſſiſtants of the Apoſtles; or ordinary and perpetual, as that of Paſtors and Teachers.</p>
               <p>The words Elder, Biſhop, Paſtor, are names of the ſame Sacred Office, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. where their Miniſtry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church is ſet forth in <hi>Pauls</hi> words to the Elders which he ſent for from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Miletum; Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles beſides their extraordinary Office of Apoſtleſhip, had alſo the ordinary Office of Biſhops, paſtors and Elders; or (to ſpeak peradventure more properly) they had theſe ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces included in their Apoſtleſhip. Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter, Feed my ſheep.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> calls himſelf an Elder, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. And <hi>John</hi> in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64714:21"/>his ſecond and third Epiſtles ſo calls himſelf. And indeed if it were not ſo, they could have no ſucceſſors or partakers. Howbeit the Scripture gives us no evidence of their being fixed Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to particular Churches.</p>
               <p>As for the meaning of theſe names, the word Biſhop imports an Overſeer; Elder is a name of Authority borrowed from age, and applied to a Ruling-officer. The word Paſtor is metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſignifying that this Officer is to the Congregation of God as a Shepherd to a Flock of ſheep, to feed them.</p>
               <p>This feeding conſiſts in teaching and ruling; ſo that every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor is in the nature of his office a Teacher, and he feeds by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And indeed Paſtoral Ruling is by teaching; ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authoritative Church-teacher is a Paſtor; for the Paſtor rules only by the ſpiritual ſword, which is the word of God; and the diſcipline which he exerciſes, is no more than than the perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſts word in his name, to judg the impenitent, and abſolve the penitent. And every authoritative Teacher in Chriſts name hath power to make ſuch perſonal application of the word.</p>
               <p>The Paſtoral Office hath its work not only towards thoſe that are within, but towards thoſe alſo that are without, to bring them into the Fold. As Chriſt the Prince of Paſtors, or chief Shepherd, doth by virtue of that office not only feed the ſheep that are gathered to him, but goes out alſo into the wilderneſs to ſeek the loſt ſheep; even ſo the Miniſterial paſtors or biſhops are by virtue of their office under Chriſt, to ſeek thoſe that are as yet going aſtray, and to bring them to Chriſt the Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of their ſouls. Thus the name <hi>Paſtor</hi> doth very congruouſly denote the Miniſterial Authority towards the unbelieving and unconverted, as well as towards believers and converts.</p>
               <p>Moreover the ſaid Officers are ſtiled Preachers of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. Stewards of the Myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Chriſt, that have the Miniſtry of Reconciliation committed to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 20. And theſe Titles infer an Office and Miniſtry relating as well to thoſe that are without, and to be brought into the Fold, as to thoſe that are within, and to be kept there; and in reference to both ſorts it is for the edifying or building of the Church.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the Paſtoral Office is a ſtate of Authority and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſpence the Word and Sacraments, and diſciplinary cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64714:22"/>of Chriſt the Mediator in his name.</p>
               <p>The Miniſterial diſpenſation of the Word, differs <hi>quoad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> from ſpiritual inſtruction, reproof, exhortation, given in a common way of Chriſtian charity, or in a ſpecial way of Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical or civil Authority, being performed by Chriſts commiſſioned Officers and Stewards in holy things, and ſeparated or devoted thereunto. And herein the Miniſters as Ambaſſadors or Heralds, according to the tenor of the Goſpel, do publiſh and offer the mercies of Chriſt upon his terms, and denounce the threatnings of Chriſt to thoſe that refuſe his Mercies.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments being ſeals annexed by Chriſt to the word of his grace, and a viſible word, are alſo to be diſpenced by them to whom the diſpenſation of the word is committed.</p>
               <p>The diſciplinary cenſures of Authoritative Reproof, Suſpenſion and Excommunication of perſons convicted of ungodlineſs and impenitency, being a particular and perſonal application of the threatnings of the Goſpel, and a declaring and judging of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unmeet for fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Church, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be adminiſtred by the ſame Officers.</p>

               <head>§ 4. <hi>The nature of the Spiritual Power reſiding in the Paſtors.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Spiritual Power of Paſtors, Biſhops, or Elders, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Author and Giver of it, in theſe terms, <hi>viz. The keys of the kingdom of heaven, binding and looſing, remitting and retaining ſins.</hi> To underſtand the true import of theſe terms, is to underſtand the Power enquired of. The keys of the kingdom of Heaven, ſignifie the Stewardſhip of Chriſts Goſpel, to diſpence to every one a due portion thereof, according to his command. Binding and looſing, is a Miniſterial Authority of holding impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners under the curſe, and abſolving the penitent from it, only by the word of Chriſt generally or perſonally applied; and it may further ſignifie a Miniſterial prohibiting of that which is unlawful, and allowing of that which is lawful, by the doctrine of Chriſt. And the power of remitting and retaining ſins as granted to Miniſters, is only that of meer Stewards or Diſpenſers of the Bleſſing or the Curſe that hath proceeded out of the mouth of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64714:22"/>Chriſt their Lord; and there appears no grant from Chriſt to his Miniſters of other power than what is here expreſſed, or what is implyed in it, or by neceſſary conſequence follows from it.</p>
               <p>In reference to the miniſterial power, a great Scholar diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth between a Vicar and a mere Miniſter, and ſaith, a Vicar doth produce actions of the ſame kind with him whoſe Vicar he is (his words are <hi>actiones congeneres</hi>) tho leſs perfectly; but a mere miniſter doth not produce ſuch actions; but only ſuch as are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the action of the principal cauſe. Therefore the name of the ſame action is properly, yet analogically attributed to the Vicar as to the principal; as for example, to paſs ſentence: but to the miniſter only tropically, as remitting and retaining of ſins.</p>
               <p>Indeed the ſentence of a vicarious Judg, whether juſt or unjuſt, is deciſive or definitive, and valid as to matter of legal right, till it be reverſed by the principal; but the action of a Miniſter for the remitting and retaining of ſin, is of no force, no not for a moment, if it be unjuſt, or done (as the common expreſſion is) <hi>errante cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon it follows, that the miniſterial power of remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and retaining ſins, and of binding and looſing (at leaſt as to the conſcience) is merely declarative, that is, it hath its force and vertue, as it is a true declaration of the mind of Chriſt in that particular, otherwiſe it is void and of no effect.</p>
               <p>The power of Paſtors in the acts aforeſaid is but the power of Heralds, or Ambaſſadors, and therefore only declarative.</p>
               <p>God and Chriſt doth by the law of grace abſolve or juſtifie the penitent, <hi>conſtitutivè:</hi> Even before the Paſtor pronounceth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, every penitent is by the covenant of grace juſtifyed or made righteous: Therefore the Paſtor doth abſolve or juſtifie him only <hi>declarativè:</hi> For when a man is juſtified by the law of grace, and conſequently ſo eſteemed and judged of God, what hath his officer or miniſter afterwards to do in his name, but to declare what is already done in law.</p>
               <p>As for the ſaying of <hi>Dominus expectat ſervum,</hi> that is, before God juſtifies the penitent believer who is ready to ſubmit to all his terms, he ſtays for the ſentence of abſolution to be pronounced by the Miniſter; I confeſs I underſtand not its conſiſtence with the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64714:23"/>
               <p>Wherefore the paſtoral ſentence of abſolution doth confer no new right, nor doth it perfect the right already given by the law of Chriſt; but it doth authoritatively declare that right, and ſtrengthen the aſſurance, and comfort the conſcience of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The paſtoral binding of the impenitent is not the adding of a further curſe or obligation to divine vengeance, but merely a ſolemn declaration of the curſe already paſt upon the ſinner by the law of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But as the ſolemn declaration of the Kings pardon to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rebels, and the denunciation of vengeance to the obſtinate by an authorized officer according to the law, doth ſtrengthen the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the conditional mercy, and increaſe the guilt of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in rebellion, and more forcibly preſs to obedience; ſo the like declarative acts of Chriſts Miniſters have the ſame force to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>That the power of a Paſtor in binding and looſing as to the communion and external priviledges of the Church, is more than declarative of the mind of Chriſt therein, I yet diſcern not: For tho the ſentence of an erring judg in a Civil judicatory is valid till it be reverſed; yet the erring keys have no effect, and the Church and the Members thereof are not bound by the unjuſt ſentence of a Paſtor to reject a godly perſon, that hath not given juſt ſcandal, or to carry themſelves towards him as towards one unfit for Chriſtian Communion; but they are ſtill to receive him as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Indeed the injured perſon may be bound to forbear the uſe of his right in ſome parts thereof, as coming to the Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in caſe a ſchiſm or diſturbance would follow: But this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation doth not ariſe from any validity that is in the unjuſt ſentence, but from the duty of preſerving peace and order.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of the power of Order, and the power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, is vain. For the ſpiritual Paſtor or Elder hath no other power than the power of the Keys, and the full power of the Keys intrinſecally belongs to the order or office of a Paſtor or Elder. But if any pretend that the full power of the Keys doth not intrinſecally belong to the office of a Paſtor or Elder, but a part only, or that there be two kinds of power of the Keys, the one whereof belongs only to one ſuperior kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <head>§ 5. <hi>Of the Delegation of Spiritual Power.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE delegation of power is a derivation thereof from its ordinary ſubject, to another who is not the ordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, and who hath right to exerciſe it merely as autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the ordinary ſubject thereof; as when a Biſhop delegates his epiſcopal power to him, who is no Biſhop, and who exerciſes the ſame merely by vertue of his delegation.</p>
               <p>The office of a Biſhop, Paſtor or Elder, is a truſt, and that of the greateſt conſequence in the world, and a truſt may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated by the receiver to another perſon without the expreſs conſent of the giver. No ſubordinate officer can make a legal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty unleſs he be authorized thereunto by law, or in his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Charter from the ſupream power: And Chriſt hath not expreſt his conſent to the transferring of this truſt, nor given au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his Miniſters to make ſuch Delegation.</p>
               <p>That Princes and Soveraign Powers b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Gods Truſtees, do transfer the work of their truſt to Delegates and ſubordinate officers, is no ground for Chriſts Miniſters to do the like: For firſt, Chriſts Miniſters are only authorized Ambaſſadors, Heralds, and not Spiritual Soveraigns under him, as the ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are Civil Soveraigns under God. 2. It is in the nature of civil ſoveraignty to make delegates and ſubordinate officers of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power, and the due Government of the Civil State makes it neceſſary; but there is no ſuch thing in the nature of the paſtoral office, and no neceſſity for it in Eccleſiaſtical Government. 3. The ſpecification of magiſtracy or civil power is left to men, but the ſpiritual power is ſpecified by Chriſt, and by him appropriated to officers of his own inſtitution. 4. Chriſt to provide for his flock hath taken another courſe than to authorize Biſhops and Paſtors to do their work by Delegates, namely, to command the ordaining of more Biſhops or Elders as need requires.</p>
               <p>The delegation of Epiſcopal Power is a repugnancy in it ſelf. For it is the power of the keys, or of ſtewarſhip in Chriſts houſe, of binding and looſing, of remitting and retaining ſins in Chriſts name, by ſpecial authority from him. And can any that is not Chriſts officer ſo authorized, exert ſuch power?</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64714:24"/>
               <p>Beſides, if one part of the biſhops proper work, <hi>viz.</hi> The exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Government, may be delegated to one that is no biſhop, why may not any other part of his work be ſo delegated, as the ordaining of miniſters? And if it be replied, <hi>ad ordinem pertinet ordinare,</hi> by as good reaſon it may be ſaid, that it as incommunicably belongs to the order or office of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to exerciſe Chriſts Diſcipline, as to ordain Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Indeed a Vicar being of the ſame ſacred office or order, may ſo exert the ſaid power in the place of another, as that his act is valid. But it may well be queſtioned, whether any biſhop may make one or more vicarious biſhops to execute his charge, for every biſhop hath received a truſt from Chriſt to be fulfilled in his own perſon, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.7. And I do not find that Chriſt hath granted a faculty to any biſhop to fulfil his Miniſtry by a Vicar of his own order.</p>
               <p>But I do not queſtion, but a biſhop may have an aſſiſtant or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants of his own order, either occaſionally in caſe of preſent diſability or juſtifiable avocation; or ſtatedly when the flock that is under his perſonal overſight requires more work than one man can do. And then the ſaid aſſiſtants are not his Vicars, but collegues, performing each of them their own part in the work and ſervice of their Lord Chriſt.</p>

               <p>IT is granted by the aſſertors of prelacy, that the names Biſhop and Presbyter are uſed promiſcuouſly: Now they that aſſert two diſtinct offices under promiſcuous names, had need bring clear proof for the diſtinction of thoſe offices: Howbeit I do not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſt on the names as indifferently uſed; but whereſoever the ſacred office of Presbyterate is ſet forth in Scripture, it is ſet forth as the office of a ſpiritual Paſtor or Biſhop, which is to feed the Flock of God by teaching and ruling it; And ſuch a Presbyter as is a ſacred officer of the Chriſtian Church, but not a Biſhop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, is not to be found in Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 7. ſhews not only an identity of name, but of office. To give order for the admiſſion of none to the office of an Elder but one ſo qualified, becauſe a Biſhop muſt be ſo qualified, is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64714:24"/>if the biſhop be of a diſtinct office from the Presbyter, and ſuperior to him.</p>

               <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.12. The elders are exhorted to feed the Flock of God which is among them, and to take the overſight thereof; and under the force of theſe two words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops claim their whole power of government.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The Apoſtle immediately paſſeth from the Biſhop to the Deacon, and takes no notice of ſuch an officer as a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter below a Biſhop, and above a Deacon: And neither this nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Scripture doth afford us the leaſt notice of any qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ordination, or any ſacred work and duty belonging to a Presbyter, who is no biſhop. Not one place of Scripture doth ſet forth any Presbyter as leſs than a biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 1, 1. <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of Biſhops and Deacons in the Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> in the inſcription of his Epiſtle, but no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Presbyters that were not biſhops. And it ſeems by that Text that in the Apoſtles times there were more biſhops than one placed in one city; and 'tis to be noted, that <hi>Philippi</hi> was but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City under the Metropolis of <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus biſhop and elder in the places aforecited, are names of the ſame office, whatſoever it be; and the Hierarchical Divines grant as much, but are not agreed what office is there ſet forth by thoſe names. One part of them think that thoſe Texts ſpeak of, or at leaſt comprehend ſuch Presbyters as are now ſo called: The other part of them think they ſpeak of ſuch biſhops as are now diſtinct from presbyters: Now they that hold that the ſaid Texts ſpeak of or include ſuch presbyters as are now ſo called, muſt needs hold that ſuch presbyters are paſtors and biſhops in the Scripture ſence of thoſe names, and ſo an identity of the biſhop and presbyter is confeſſed, and it reſts upon them to prove the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution of biſhops of a higher order over ſuch presbyters; and they that hold that the ſaid Texts ſpeak of ſuch biſhops as are now diſtinct from presbyters, muſt needs grant, the qualification, ordination, and work of presbyters inferior to biſhops is not ſet forth in Scripture.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64714:25"/>
               <p>If it be ſaid that the order of inferior and ſubject presbyters is of divine inſtitution, and yet not defined or expreſſed in Scripture, let a ſatisfactory proof be brought from ſome other authority of its divine inſtitution, and what its nature is.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that at firſt the function of a biſhop and presbyter was one, but afterwards it was divided into two, and that the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made by divine warrant, the aſſerters are bound to prove it by ſufficient authority.</p>
               <p>To have the power of the keys, of binding and looſing, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and retaining ſins in Chriſts name, as his commiſſioned Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, is to have Epiſcopal power, and this power belongs to a Presbyter. The Aſſerters of Prelacy anſwer this, by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the keys <hi>in foro interiore,</hi> or the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within; and <hi>foro exteriore,</hi> in the exterior Court, to wit, that of the Church; and ſay that the former belongs to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Presbyter both, and the latter to the Biſhop only. To which I reply, 1. The Scripture makes no ſuch diſtinction; and where the Law diſtinguiſheth not, we may not diſtinguiſh. 2. The diſtinction is vain: for all power that belongs to the Paſtors of the Church purely, reſpects the conſcience, by applying to it the commands, promiſes, and threatnings of God; and it reſpects the conſcience, as having the conduct of the outward man, and that in reference to Church communion, as well as other matters. 3. If Presbyters may in the name of Chriſt bind the impenitent, and looſe the penitent as to the conſcience in the ſight of God, which is the greater and primary binding and looſing; then by parity of reaſon, and that with advantage, they may bind and looſe as to Church-communion, which is the leſſer, ſecondary and ſubſequent binding and looſing.</p>
               <p>That Officer is a Biſhop that hath power of authoritative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in Chriſts name, that this or that wicked perſon in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is unworthy of fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Church, and a power of charging the Congregation in Chriſts name not to keep company with him, as being no fit member of a Chriſtian Society; and alſo a power of Authoritative declaring and judging in Chriſts name, that the ſame perſon repenting of his wickedneſs, and giving evidence thereof, is meet for fellowſhip with Chriſt and his church, and a power of requiring the Congregation in Chriſts name again to receive him into their Chriſtian fellowſhip. For theſe are the powers of Excommunication, and Eccleſiaſtical Abſolution; and a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64714:25"/>Presbyter hath apparently the ſaid powers. As he can undoubtedly declare, and charge, and judg, as aforeſaid, touching perſons in general; ſo by parity of reaſon, touching this or that perſon in particular; all particulars being included in the general. He hath undoubtedly a power of applying the word in Chriſts name, as well perſonally as generally. That a Presbyter hath the ſaid powers, is granted by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the common uſage of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, wherein a Presbyter is appointed to denounce the ſentence of Excommunication, tho the Chancellor doth decree it. And the Excommunication is not compleat, till a Presbyter hath denounced it in the congregation.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtles have no ſucceſſors in the whole of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is confeſſed on all hands; but if they have ſucceſſors in part of their Office, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Paſtoral Authority, in this reſpect the Presbyters, if any, are their ſucceſſors. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorting the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ſtiles himſelf their fellow-Presbyter, which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in reſpect of the power of Teaching and Ruling.</p>
               <p>The Paſtoral Authority of Presbyters is further cleared in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſages in the publick forms of the Church of <hi>England</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Order.</p>
               <p>The form of Ordaining Presbyters in this Church, lately was, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſins thou remitteſt, they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and whoſe ſins thou retaineſt, they are retained; and be thou a faithful diſpenſer of the word of God, and of his holy Sacraments, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Now the former part hereof is intirely the words uſed by our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22. towards the Apoſtles, expreſſing their Paſtoral Authority. And the latter part is no derogation or diminution from the power granted in the former part. If Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not partakers with the Apoſtles in the Paſtoral Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how could they have Right to that Form of Ordination?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe this Church did in ſolemn form of words require the presbyters when they were ordained, to exerciſe the diſcipline of Chriſt as the Lord hath commanded, and this Realm hath received the ſame, according to the commandment of God. And that they might the better underſtand what the Lord hath commanded therein, this Church did appoint alſo, That at the ordering of Prieſts there be read for the Epiſtle that portion of <hi>Acts</hi> 20. which relates St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſending to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and calling for the Elders of the Congregation, with his exhortation to them, <hi>To take heed to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64714:26"/>themſelves, and to all the flock, whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, to rule the congregation of God.</hi> Or elſe 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. which ſets forth the Office and due Qualifications of a Biſhop. Theſe portions of Scripture this Church appointed to be read to the Presbyters, as belonging to their Office, and to inſtruct them in the nature of it. And afterwards the Biſhop ſpeaks to them that are to receive the Office of Prieſthood, in this form of words: <hi>You have heard brethren, as well in your private examination, as in the exhortation and holy leſſons taken out of the Goſpel, and the writings of the Apoſtles, of what dignity, and how great importance this Office is whereto ye are called; that is to ſay, The Meſſengers, the Watchmen, the paſtors and ſtewards of the Lord, to teach, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, to feed, to provide for the Lords Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acknowledg the paſſages here alledged are taken out of the old Book of Ordinanion that was eſtabliſhed in this Church till the late alteration made <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. If thoſe Alterations ſignifie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning about the ſeveral Holy Orders, than what was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the Old Book, then the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in theſe times, differs from the ſenſe of the ſame Church in all times preceding the ſaid Alterations. But if they ſignifie no other meaning than what was ſignified in the old Book, my Citations are of force to ſhew what is the ſenſe of this Church, as well of the preſent as of the former times about this matter.</p>
               <p>And let this be further conſidered, That the form of ordaining a Biſhop according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> imports not the conferring of a higher power, or an authorizing to any ſpecial work, more than to what the Presbyter is authorized. The old form was, <hi>Take the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and <hi>remember that thou ſtir up the grace of God that is in thee, by impoſition of hands: for God hath not given us the ſpirit of fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, but of power, and of love, and of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs.</hi> What is there in this form of words, that might not be uſed to a Presbyter at his ordination? Or what is there in it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of more power than what belongs to a Presbyter? The new form ſince the late alteration, is, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt for the work and office of a Biſhop in the Church of God, now committed to thee by impoſition of our hands, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, Amen And remember that thou ſtir up the grace of God that is given thee by this impoſition of our hands; f r God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of ſoberneſs.</hi> And what is there in this form that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64714:26"/>of any office power that the Presbyter hath not, unleſs theſe words, <hi>for the work and office of a biſhop?</hi> Now both the name, and work, and office of a biſhop, belongs to the Scripture-presbyter, who is of divine inſtitution; and the presbyter to whom it doth not belong, is but a humane creature, or an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man.</p>

               <head>§ 7. <hi>Of the preſent Dioceſan Biſhop.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Dioceſan Biſhop according to the hierarchical ſtate, is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the loweſt degree, having under him Pariſh-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that are Presbyters or Prieſts, but not accounted Biſhops, and by divine right claiming to himſelf alone the Epiſcopal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over all the Pariſh Churches and Miniſters within his Dioceſs, which may contain a hundred, two hundred, five hundred, or a thouſand pariſhes: For an Epiſcopacy of this kind I diſcern no Scripture-Warrant nor Divine Right.</p>
               <p>Every particular Church ſhould have its proper paſtor or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and particular Churches with their proper paſtors are ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently of divine right, that ſome eminently learned men in the Church of <hi>England</hi> have declared their judgment that no form of Church-Government beſides the mere paſtoral office and Church-Aſſemblies, is preſcribed in the Word of God, but may be various according to the various condition and occaſion of ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſaid that parochial Congregations are not Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches but only parts of the Dioceſs, which is the loweſt political Church, I deſire proof from Scripture, that ſuch Congregations as our pariſhes having their proper presbyter or presbyters inveſted with the power of the keys, are not Churches properly ſo called. The reaſon of demanding this proof is, becauſe the Scripture is a perfect rule for the eſſential conſtitution of Churches, though the accidents thereto belonging may be regulated by humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And it is moſt evident in Scripture, that a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Chriſtians having their proper paſtor or paſtors, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter or presbyters, are Churches properly ſo called, and a paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Miniſter I conceive to be a paſtor, presbyter, or elder, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:64714:27"/>
               <p>Moreover if a Dioceſs containing many hundred, or perhaps a thouſand pariſhes (as it doth in <hi>England</hi>) do conſtitute but one particular Church, and the pariſhes be not properly to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches, but only ſo many parts of that one dioceſan Church, why may not ten thouſand, yea, ten times ten thouſand pariſhes be likewiſe accounted but one particular church, and brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one man as the ſole biſhop or paſtor thereof?</p>
               <p>Nor do I diſcern how it is poſſible for one man to do the work of a biſhop towards ſo many pariſhes, which is to overſee all the flock, to preach to them all, to baptize and confirm all that are to be baptized and confirmed, to adminiſter the Lords Supper to all, to bleſs the congregation, publickly and privately to admoniſh all as their need requires, to excommunicate the impenitent, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the penitent, and that upon knowledg of their particular eſtate: for all theſe are paſtoral or epiſcopal acts. And let it here be noted, that I ſpeak of the work of a biſhop <hi>infimi gradus,</hi> or under whom there are no ſubordinate biſhops.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a Dioceſan biſhop ſaith, it ſufficeth that he perform all this to the flock by others, namely, by the pariſh miniſters as his Curates, and by other officers his ſubſtitutes: It is anſwered, 1. The paſtoral Authority is a perſonal truſt. 2. He is to ſhew his commiſſion from Chriſt the prince of paſtors, to do his work by others; for I am now enquiring what is of divine, and not of humane Right. 3. None but a biſhop can do the proper work of a biſhop; and conſequently, the presbyters by whom the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan doth his work, either are biſhops, or their act is an uſurpation and a nullity.</p>
               <p>It is matter of divine Right only that is here conſidered. As for the humane Rights of a Dioceſan biſhop, to wit, his dignity, and his juriſdiction under the King as Supreme, and to which he is intituled by the Law of the Land, I intermeddle not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>

               <p>THE Divine Right of a biſhop <hi>infimi gradus,</hi> Ruling over many churches as their ſole hiſhop or paſtor, hath been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and now it is to be conſidered, Whether there be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64714:27"/>inſtitution, ſuch a ſpiritual officer as hath the overſight of Biſhops, or is a Biſhop of Biſhops. The Dioceſan Biſhop is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of this kind, tho he will not own it; for he is a biſhop of Presbyters, who are really biſhops, if they be that kind of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters that the Scripture mentions. But if the Presbyters, which in the hierarchical ſtate are ſubject to the Dioceſan Biſhop, be of another kind, they are not of Chriſts inſtitution.</p>
               <p>What hath been already ſaid againſt the Epiſcopacy of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>infimi gradus</hi> over many Churches, makes not againſt the right of an overſeer of other biſhops, ſuch as <hi>Titus</hi> muſt needs be, if he were indeed biſhop of <hi>Crete,</hi> which contained a hundred Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and where biſhops or elders were ordained in every City: If either Scripture or Prudence guided by Scripture, be for ſuch an office, I oppoſe it not.</p>
               <p>Now a biſhop of biſhops may be taken in a twofold notion, either for one of a higher order; that is to ſay, of an office ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically different from the ſubordinate biſhops, or for one of a higher degree only in the ſame order. I ſuppoſe our Archbiſhops of Provinces do not own the former notion of a biſhop of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but the latter only. But the biſhop of a Dioceſs is <hi>de facto</hi> that which the Archbiſhop of a Province doth not own, namely, a biſhop of biſhops in a different order from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Dioceſs, who have been already proved from Scripture to be biſhops.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the preſent inquiry is, Whether the Word of God doth warrant the office of a biſhop of biſhops in either of the ſaid notions. And in this inquiry I ſhall conſider what kind of Government the Apoſtles had over the Paſtors or Elders of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches 2.

               </head>
               <p>THO the Apoſtles in reſpect of that in them, which was common to other officers, call themſelves Presbyters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but never biſhops; yet it is aſſerted by the aſſerters of Prelacy, that biſhops ſuperior to Presbyters are the Apoſtles ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and thereupon have a governing-power over Presbyters. Wherefore the Apoſtles governing-power, and the ſaid biſhops right of ſucceſſion thereunto, is neceſſarily to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>As touching this claimed ſucceſſion in the governing power, the defenders of prelacy ſay, that Presbyters, <hi>qua</hi> Presbyters, ſucceed the Apoſtles in the office of governing. But the Scripture doth not warrant this dividing of the office of teaching and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And if the diviſion cannot be proved, in caſe there be a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, it muſt be into the whole, and not into a part; and ſo the Presbyters muſt ſucceed as well in ruling as in teaching: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it hath been already proved, that an authoritative Teacher of the Church is <hi>qua talis</hi> a Ruler.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles had no ſucceſſors in their ſpecial office of Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For not only the unction or qualification of an Apoſtle, but alſo the intire Apoſtolick office as in its formal ſtate or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick difference, was extraordinary, and expired with their perſons. It was an office by immediate Vocation from Chriſt without the intervention of man by election or ordination, for the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick promulgation of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and the erecting of the Chriſtian Church throughout the World, which is built on the foundation of their Doctrine, and for the governing of all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wherever they came; and it eminently contained all the power of ordinary biſhops and paſtors The continuation of teaching and governing in the Church, doth no more prove that the office of teaching and governing in the Apoſtles was <hi>quoad formale,</hi> an ordinary office, than that the office of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing in Chriſt himſelf was ſo: But their teaching
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64714:28"/>and governing was by immediate call, and authentick and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable, and therefore extraordinary. And I do not know that the biſhops ſay they are Apoſtles, tho they ſay they are the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Moreover in proper ſpeaking, the ordinary biſhops or elders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reckoned the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, for they were not ſuccedaneous to them, but contemporary with them from the firſt planting of churches, and did by divine right receive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their governing-power. And the biſhops or elders of all ſucceeding ages are properly the ſucceſſors of thoſe firſt biſhops or elders, and can rightfully claim no more power than they had.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs let the Apoſtles governing power be inquired into, as alſo what intereſt the biſhops of the Hierarchical ſtate have therein. And in this query it is to be conſidered; That the Presbyters, whom the Apoſtles ordained and governed, were bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops both in name and thing, and conſequently their example of ordaining and ruling ſuch Presbyters, is not rightly alledged to prove that biſhops as their ſucceſſors have an appropriated power of ordaining and ruling Presbyters of an inferior order, which in Scripture times were not in being. Further it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Whether the ſaid governing-power were only a ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent authority which they had as Apoſtles, and infallible, and to whom the laſt appeals in matters of religion were to be made; or an ordinary governing power over the Churches, and the biſhops or elders thereof. I conceive it moſt rational to take it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe: For we find that the ordinary ſtated government of particular Churches was in the particular Biſhops or Elders, and we find not that any of the Apoſtles did take away the ſame from them, or that it was ſuperceded by their preſence, or that they reſerved to themſelves a negative voice in the government of the Churches.</p>
               <p>Now if their governing power were only the ſaid ſupereminent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick authority, they had no ſucceſſors therein; and tho teaching and ruling be of ſtanding neceſſity, and conſequently of perpetual duration in the Church, yet there is no ſtanding neceſſity of that teaching and ruling as taken formally in that extraordinary ſtate and manner as before expreſſed.</p>
               <p>But if they exerciſed an ordinary governing-power over the Churches and biſhops to be continued by ſucceſſion, ſuch kind of Biſhops, over whom that power was exerciſed, cannot claim a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64714:29"/>right of ſucceſſion into the ſame; but they muſt be officers of an higher <hi>orb.</hi> Conſequently if the Hierarchical Biſhops claim the right of ſucceſſion to the Apoſtles in their governing-power, they muſt needs be of a higher <hi>orb</hi> than the firſt Biſhops of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches over whom that power was exerciſed: And if this Hypotheſis of the Apoſtles having an ordinary governing-power over the Churches and Biſhops, do ſufficiently prove the right of the ſucceſſion of Biſhops of a higher <hi>orb</hi> in the ſame power, I ſhall not oppoſe it; But only I take notice, that theſe higher Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are not of the ſame kind with thoſe firſt biſhops that were under that governing power, and of which we read in Scripture.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtles ſhould be Dioceſan Biſhops was not conſiſtent with their Apoſtolick office, being a general charge extending to the Church univerſal. That any Apoſtle did appropriate a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to himſelf, and challenge the ſole Epiſcopal authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cannot be proved. The ſeveral Apoſtles for the better carrying on of the work of their office, did make choice of ſeveral regions, more eſpecially to exerciſe their function in. There was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould go to the Circumciſion, and <hi>Paul</hi> to the Uncircumciſion: But as it doth not hence follow that <hi>Peter</hi> was a fixed Biſhop of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> no more were any of the Apoſtles fixed Biſhops in thoſe places where they were more eſpecially imployed, and we know that they made frequent removes.</p>

               <p>THE Name of Biſhop is not given either to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> except in the Poſtſcripts of the Epiſtles. But thoſe Poſtſcripts are taken for no part of Canonical Scripture. For if they were free from the objected Errors about the places from which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles were written, they cannot in reaſon be ſuppoſed to be <hi>Pauls</hi> own words, and written by him when the Epiſtles were written.</p>
               <p>Moreover the travels of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> do evidently ſhew, that they were not dioceſan biſhops, nor the ſetled Overſeers of particular churches.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:64714:29"/>
               <p>And thoſe paſſages 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>I beſought thee to abide ſtill at Epheſus;</hi> and Tit. 1.5. <hi>For this cauſe I left thee in Crete,</hi> ſhew an occaſional and temporary employment. And whatſoever ſtreſs may be laid upon theſe texts to prove they were biſhops of thoſe places, yet they do not ſound like the fixing of them each in their proper dioceſs.</p>
               <p>The name of an Evangeliſt is expreſly given to one of them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. and the work enjoined both of them, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed by them, being throughout of the ſame kind, there is all reaſon to believe that they had the ſame kind of office.</p>
               <p>Now by ſeveral texts of Scripture compared together, we find the work of Evangeliſts to be partly ſuch as belonged to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whoſe Agents or Adjuncts they were; and partly ſuch as was common to Paſtors and Teachers, whoſe office was included in theirs. Their work in common with the Apoſtles, was the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſetling of churches, by travelling from place to place; and in this regard they have been well called Apoſtles of the Apoſtles. And in doing this Vice-apoſtolick ſervice, they did alſo that which was common to paſtors and teachers, in teaching and ruling, but with this difference, that the ordinary paſtors did it ſtatedly in thoſe churches where they were fixed; but theſe tranſiently in ſeveral churches, which they were ſent to erect or eſtabliſh, or to ſet things in order therein, as the Apoſtles ſaw need.</p>
               <p>Or if <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not in an office eſſentially divers from the ordinary paſtors and teachers; yet they were in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſervice, as being the Apoſtles Agents, and being in that capacity, might have their intrinſick ſpiritual power enlarged to a greater extent, and higher pitch of exerciſe than the ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Howbeit I rather judg that they had an office ſpecifically different from that of the ordinary paſtors, becauſe in the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſeveral ſacred offices, <hi>Paul</hi> mentions the office of an Evangeliſt as a diſtinct kind from the reſt.</p>
               <p>But if it can be proved that the Superiority of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> over biſhops or elders of particular churches, was not as they were the Apoſtles aſſiſtants, or as extraordinary and temporary officers, but as ordinary ſuperiors, it will indeed follow that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, or biſhops of biſhops, are of divine Right. Nevertheleſs the Epiſcopal authority of biſhops or presbyters of particular churches (ſuch as the Scripture-biſhops were) remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken.</p>

To which many things are ſaid by thoſe of the other perſuaſion; As, that thoſe Angels are not called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nor any where implied to be biſhops in the preſent Vulgar ſenſe of the word: That the denomination of Angels and Stars in the judgment of ancient and modern Writers, do belong to the Miniſters of the Word in general: That in myſterious or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Writings, and Viſional Repreſentations, a number of things or perſons is uſually expreſſed by ſingulars; and that it is very probable, that the term <hi>Angel</hi> is explained under that plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>you,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from <hi>the reſt, Apoc.</hi> 2.24. but <hi>to you and the reſt in Thyatira, &amp;c.</hi> and to be a collective name expreſſing all the Elders of that church.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſome obſerve, that it might be expreſſed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Gods providence in the adminiſtration of the World by Angels is expreſſed, wherein one being ſet as chief over ſuch a countrey, the things which are done by many, are attributed to one Angel preſident.</p>
               <p>It is further to be conſidered, that in the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> one of the ſeven, the Scripture makes mention of many biſhops, who were no other than presbyters, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Againſt this ſome ſay, That the Elders there mentioned, were not the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but the biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſent for by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Miletum.</hi> But 1. This is affirmed altogether without proof. 2. The text ſaith, <hi>Paul</hi> ſent from <hi>Miletum</hi> to <hi>Epheſus</hi> to call the elders of the church, which in rational interpretation muſt be the Elders of the church to which he ſent. 3. If the biſhops of all <hi>Aſia</hi> had been meant, it would have been ſaid the Elders of the churches. For in Scripture, tho we find the Chriſtians of one city called a church, yet the Chriſtians of a Region did ever make a plurality of churches, as the churches of <hi>Judea,</hi> the churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> 4. There is not the leaſt hint given of the meeting of the biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for the elders of the Church. 5. The aſſerters of prelacy hold
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64714:30"/>that <hi>Timothy</hi> was the firſt biſhop of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> now <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſend for him, for he was already preſent with him, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in his travels: Nor did he commit the charge of the church to him, but to the Elders that were ſent for. 6. It could not be the ſence of the church of <hi>England,</hi> that thoſe Elders who are declared to be biſhops, were biſhops in the Vulgar meaning of the word, when ſhe appointed that portion of Scripture to be read at the ordination of Presbyters, to inſtruct them in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and work of their Office.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, That by the Angel of the church is meant the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator or Preſident of the Presbytery, who might be either for a time, or always the ſame perſon; and the Epiſtle might be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in the ſame manner as when the King ſends a Meſſage to the Parliament, he directs it to the Speaker. Now ſuch a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator or Preſident makes nothing for biſhops of a higher order than Presbyters.</p>

                  </gap>ver they ſaw need. Now this deſcription doth not make them of a ſpecifically different Order from the ordinary presbyters, and it ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their Miniſtry to the Apoſtles times. <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, they were presbyters tyed to no place, and that many ſuch Evangeliſts were ordained long after; and thereupon concludes, that not to ordain without a title to ſome particular place, is not of divine right.</p>
               <p>Indeed if the office of an Evangeliſt be no other than that of a general Miniſter, or a presbyter tyed to no place, it ſeems not only to have been requiſite in the Apoſtles times, but to be of ſtanding conveniency, if not of neceſſity in the church And his not being limited to one church, is but the extending of the common office
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64714:31"/>of a presbyter or biſhop, and not the making of a new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. For this more extenſive power of a general Miniſter, is only the having of that in ordinary exerciſe, which, every Miniſter hath in <hi>actu primo,</hi> by vertue of his relation to the Catholick church (in which Teachers and Paſtors are ſet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28.) and into which his miniſterial acts of teaching and baptizing have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yea, which he hath by vertue of his relation to Chriſt as a ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to an houſholder in his Family, and as a delegate to the chief paſtor for the calling of the unconverted, as well as for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of Converts. Now the more or leſs extenſive exerciſe of an Office, is a matter of humane prudence, and variable according to time and place.</p>
               <p>But that a general Miniſter be of a higher order than fixed bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or presbyters, is not of ſtanding or perpetual neceſſity. Nor is it always neceſſary that he be in a ſtate of ſuperintendency over them. Nevertheleſs, if a ſuperintendency be granted to him by the conſent of the churches and paſtors, for the common good, or by the Magiſtrate, as to his delegate in his authority in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs, I cannot condemn it, but rather judg that it may be ſometimes not only expedient, but neceſſary. Yet it is not of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, but of prudential determination.</p>

               <p>AS touching the Angel of a Church, it being a myſtical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in a myſtical book, it may be rationally queſtioned, Whether it be meant of one perſon, or of a number of Colleagues; as may appear by what hath been already noted.

               </head>
               <p>THESE have been commonly called Lay-Elders; but ſome have diſliked that name, alledging that they are ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; but they own the name of Ruling Elders. Now it is to be noted, that the aſſerters of the divine right of this office, make it not an office of total dedication to ſacred imployment, as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Miniſter, but allow ſuch as bear it to have ſecular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not only occaſionally, but as their ſtated particular calling; alſo that they make it not an office of final dedication to ſacred imployment as the office of a Miniſter is, but grant that ſuch as bear it, may ceaſe from it, and again become no Elders: Alſo they make not theſe Elders to have office power in all Churches as Miniſters have, <hi>actu primo,</hi> but only in their own particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and in Claſſical and Synodical aſſemblies; nor do they aſcribe unto theſe Elders the power of the keys of binding and looſing, of remitting and retaining ſins, which belong to Miniſters, nor do they ſolemnly ordain theſe Elders by prayer and impoſition of hands, as Miniſters are ordained.</p>
               <p>Now the Query is, whether Chriſt hath inſtituted in his Church ſuch a ſpiritual officer as this ruling Elder, who is not totally nor finally dedicated to ſacred imployment, but ſtatedly left to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar callings, and hath no office power, no not in <hi>actu primo</hi> in the church at large, but only in his own church, or in ſuch an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as that Church helps to make up; nor hath the power of the keys of binding and looſing, of remitting and retaining ſins, nor is ordained by prayer and impoſition of hands? I ſay, whether Chriſt hath inſtituted ſuch an officer, and authorized him in his name as his ſteward to admit into or caſt out of his Family the Church? I find nothing in Holy Scripture to warrant his divine right; nor can I ſee in reaſon how one deſtitute of the above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named capacities can put forth acts of ſpiritual Diſcipline, or of binding and looſing in Chriſt, Name.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:64714:32"/>
               <p>In the New Teſtament there be three ſignifications of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the firſt belonging to age, the ſecond to Magiſtracy in the greater or leſſer Sanhedrim, the third to miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The only place that hath a ſhew of mentioning the ruling Elder in the Church that is not a Miniſter of the Goſpel, is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Elders that rule well,</hi> &amp;c. But this hath nothing cogently to evince two different kinds of officers, but that of thoſe in the ſame office ſome may be imployed more eſpecially in one part of the work thereof, and others in another part, and that the being more abundantly imployed in the Word and Doctrine, hath the preeminence. The Emphaſis lies in <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>THERE is no neceſſity of adding the above-named Ruling Elder to the Miniſters of the Goſpel in the Government of the Church: For Chriſt hath committed to his Miniſters the keys or ſtewardſhip of his houſe; and he hath committed the ſame to them not only as to a Presbytery conſtituted of many, but alſo to each of them as ſingle Presbyters. And where there is but one Presbyter in a Church, his acts of Diſcipline are as lawful and valid
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64714:32"/>in his own Church as thoſe that are done by many in a Church where there are many Presbyters: And the contrary opinion is precarious, and not founded in Scripture.</p>
               <p>As for that paſſage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Sufficient to ſuch a man is this puniſhment that was inflicted by many:</hi> from thence to infer that a Church-cenſure may not be adminiſtred by one Miniſter, is to draw a general concluſion from one inſtance; or becauſe a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was inflicted by many in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where there were many Miniſters, therefore it ought to be ſo in all Churches, even where there is but one Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the true nature of a Church-cenſure were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there would be no reaſon to doubt of its being lawfully or validly adminiſtred by one perſon. For it is no more than autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative declaring and judging in Chriſts Name, that ſuch a one is unmeet for fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Church, and a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Congregation in Chriſts Name to avoid him.</p>
               <p>Indeed thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> are to be conſidered and cleared: For it is from hence argued, that the Church being a collective name, betokens a number, and therefore not one but many are to hear and cenſure matters of ſcandal. To which argument it may be firſt replyed, That a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery or company of Presbyters is in Scripture no more called the Church, than one Miniſter: But the anſwer is, that by the rule of interpretation words and names muſt be limited with reſpect to the matter treated of; and ſo the word Church in the ſaid text is to be underſtood of the Church as governing, and therefore reſpects not the governed, but the governing-part thereof, which is but one perſon in a Church that hath but one Biſhop or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Apoſtle wrote his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the whole Church, and ſaith <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>When ye are gathered together to deliver ſuch a one to Satan.</hi> v. 13. <hi>Put away from yourſelves that wicked perſon.</hi> Now in theſe places he doth not explicitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his ſpeech to the Elders; but in all reaſon it muſt be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with reſpect to the governing-part of that Church, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Presbyter.</p>
               <p>Tho there be no neceſſity of a Ruling Elder diſtinct from a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel, to the acts of Church-Diſcipline; yet in point of expedience and prudence, ſuch as are no ſpiritual rulers, or have no power formally ſpiritual, may either by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magiſtrate, or by the conſent of Paſtor and People, be

               <p>THE Scripture makes mention of two Holy Orders: 1. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who are alſo Biſhops. 2. Deacons, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To the biſhops and deacons;</hi> and the third chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> having ſet forth the Office of a biſhop, paſſeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the deacon without taking notice of a presbyter of a middle order between a biſhop and deacon. And the mention of a middle order is no where found in Scripture. <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> in his Epiſtle, mentions but two orders, biſhops and deacons. And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> grants, That it cannot be proved that in Scripture-times there were any ſubject-presbyters; and concludes, that the churches were then governed by biſhops aſſiſted with deacons, and without presbyters, <hi>vid.</hi> his Annot. on <hi>Acts</hi> 11.30. and his Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, p 208, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that are agreed, that there is ſuch an office as a Deacon by divine right, are not agreed what it is; yet all are agreed, that it is an inferior order of miniſtry aſſiſtant to the biſhop or elder in the affairs of the church; but in what kind of aſſiſtance, there is diverſity of opinion.</p>
               <p>Some hold that this office is to take care of the poor, in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtributing among them the churches Alms. Others hold, that a deacon may preach and baptize, and aſſiſt the biſhop or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in adminiſtring the Sacrament, tho he may not conſecrate the Sacramental bread and wine, nor lay on hands, or ordain.</p>
               <p>In the 6. chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> if the inſtitution of this office be there related, we find no other miniſtry there expreſly mentioned but <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64714:33"/>mentioned without any ſpecification of the office. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8, &amp;c. the due qualification of this officer is more ſet forth than the nature and work of the office; yet ſomething thereof may be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>They that have uſed the office of a deacon well, purchaſe to themſelves a good degree.</hi> Let it be conſidered, whether by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> is not meant a degree in the Sacred miniſtry, and a ſtep to a higher order therein. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.5. we find that <hi>Philip,</hi> one of the ſeven, preached the Goſpel in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and his acts there are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if he alſo baptized the converts, <hi>v.</hi> 38. he baptized the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> Eunuch; and <hi>v.</hi> 40. he paſſed through, and preached in all the cities, till he came to <hi>Ceſarea.</hi> Now whether <hi>Philip</hi> did not theſe things, not meerly by the common duty of a Chriſtian, but by determinate ordination thereunto, it may be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Some make two ſorts of Deacons, the deacon of tables, and the deacon of the word. But this diſtinction ſeems not to be allowed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe it appoints to be read at the ordaining of Deacons both that part of Acts 6. that relates the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of the ſeven for miniſtring unto tables, and alſo that part of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. that ſpeaks of the office of a Deacon as a degree in the Holy miniſtry immediately after the biſhop.</p>
               <p>Concerning this office I aſſent to <hi>Grotius,</hi> That the deacons did ſerve the Presbyters, as the Levites the Prieſts; but the moſt labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious part of the deacons office is the care of the poor; and as nothing was lawful to the Levites that was not lawful to the Prieſts; ſo nothing is lawful to Deacons that is not lawful to Presbyters in matter of Sacred Adminiſtration.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64714:34"/>the one being extraordinary and temporary, and of the other ordinary and perpetual.</p>
               <p>And that the work which is done by miniſters be not left in common to all, but appropriated to a ſpecial office, or a ſtate of authority and obligation to do that work, there is a perpetual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the Church of God; for it being a work of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance in the world, it is neceſſary that there be in ſome a ſtate of ſpecial obligation thereunto, leſt being left as every mans work, in the iſſue it prove to be no mans work.</p>
               <p>The miniſtry being not a ſtate common to all, but a ſpecial office, it is uſurpation and intruſion for any one to take it up without a due call thereunto, that is a commiſſion or warrant to inſtate him in it. As none can be a Herald, or Ambaſſador, or Steward by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming any of theſe offices to himſelf, but he muſt have commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or warrant from the Prince or Houſholder; ſo none can be authoritative preachers of Chriſts Goſpel, or ſtewards of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, without a commiſſion from him.</p>
               <p>The Scripture declares, That a miſſion is neceſſary, Rom. 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> That is, without miſſion none preach with the authority of one of Chriſts Heralds. Accordingly, a rule is given for calling men to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, which rule is to be kept till the appearance of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.14. compared with chap. 5.17, 21. What manner of preaching the Goſpel is lawful for them that are no miniſters, hath been before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The eſſence of the call to the miniſtry lies in Chriſts command to any man to do the work of the miniſtry, and in his own conſent accordingly to give up himſelf thereunto. The ſaid command is the efficient cauſe of a mans being a miniſter; and the ſufficient ſignification of that command, and a mans own conſent, is each of them a <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> or a neceſſary condition thereof: For it hath been already ſhewed, it is Chriſt only that gives the office and power intrinſick to it, and he doth it by his publick ſtanding act in his law.

               <p>The extraordinary and immediate call did belong to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary offices; but an ordinary and mediate call to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtanding offices.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, that at certain times in an ordinary office ſuch eminent qualifications and ſucceſſes may be given to ſome, as exceed the common meaſure; yet their call is not extraordinary for the kind thereof. <hi>Luther</hi> in that high and eminent ſervice which was done by him, did not pretend an extraordinary and immediate call. And none of our firſt Reformers renounced that ordinary call which they had under the corrupt ſtate of the church.</p>
               <p>The mediate call is by the intervention of man in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of election and ordination; which is ſo to be underſtood, that neither the Electors nor Ordainers do properly make a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor give the miniſterial authority; nor doth the miniſter act by authority derived from the one or the other, nor in their name, as their officer commiſſioned by them; but by authority derived from Chriſt, and in his name as his officer. It is Chriſt therefore that gives the office by the ſtanding act of his Law immediately, that is, without any mediate efficient cauſe, yet by the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, as deſigning and inaugurating the perſon that receives it, as the King is the immediate giver of the power of a Mayor, tho the Corporation deſign the perſon that receives it; and God is the immediate giver of the Husbands power, but the application of it to ſuch a perſon is by the womans conſent.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64714:35"/>
               <p>Now in the mediate call, mans part is neceſſary as well as Gods part, and therefore in no wiſe to be neglected. For what is done by man, is neceſſary to give a ſufficient ſignification of the will of Chriſt, to put this or that perſon into the Miniſtry.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THAT Election which belongs to the ſetting up of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not always an act of government, but ſometimes of meer liberty, as when a people elect a Ruler over them.</p>
               <p>Meer Election to the Miniſtry made by men, doth not confer the office, nor apply it to the perſon; but the moſt that it doth, is to apply the perſon inveſted with the office to a certain compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the relation of their proper Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Much controverſie hath been about the right of Election, to whom it belongs. The peoples electing of their own Miniſter is juſt by the law of nature, if it be not otherwiſe ordained by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive law; as naturally all men chooſe Phyſitians for themſelves, and School-maſters for their Children, yet in ſome places and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is otherwiſe ordained, and guardians are appointed by the Supreme Power, and Phyſitians and School-maſters in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet ſo as none be conſtrained to uſe them.</p>
               <p>It doth not appear that the divine law hath preſcribed any certain way of election to the miniſtry as unfixed, beſides the mutual conſent of the ordainer and ordained. No proof of any, as to the general miniſtry, being choſen by the people appears in the New Teſtament. The Apoſtles and the Seventy had a divine election; <hi>Timothy</hi> was elected by Propheſie; and it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. That the multitude, but the Eleven Apoſtles ſet forth two, whereof one was choſen by lot to the Apoſtleſhip; and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not there ſignifie a numbring by common ſuffrages, for God made choice of <hi>Matthias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the election of thoſe ſeven Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. is expreſly declared to have been by the people: But to this it is ſaid, that it was for the avoiding of offence, and the better to quiet the murmuring among the people. It is alſo ſaid, that the peoples electing of them to that office was a matter of ſpecial equity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64714:35"/>the work thereof, as far as is there expreſſed, was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of maintenance as there was need in that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time; for which end there was a truſting of the common ſtock in the hands of them that were choſen.</p>
               <p>But in whatſoever hand the election of a miniſter lies, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſent is of great importance: For he cannot perform the work of a Paſtor to any people without their own conſent; it is plain that he cannot guide and rule them in a paſtoral way againſt their wills.</p>
               <p>Yet I know not, but that (ſometimes) they may be obliged to conſent that he be Paſtor, when he is by ſufficient warrant, and upon good grounds choſen by men for them, tho their refuſal may render themſelves uncapable of receiving benefit by him, and him uncapable of doing the work of his office towards them.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as the peoples conſent gives the miniſter the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſcharging the duties of the relation, which otherwiſe cannot be done; it is much to be regarded in the call of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to any people, and the freer the conſent, the better it is in reſpect of the ends of the paſtoral relation, and conſequently their conſent before his admiſſion is moſt deſirable; yet where there is not a conſent before, an after conſent may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>The people in electing their Paſtors, (if they have the liberty thereof) or in conſenting to the election made by others, ought ordinarily to be directed by the judgment of other Paſtors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> That we may carry the Queſtion from the meer name Paſtor to the matter, all theſe things muſt be diſtinctly conſidered. 1. What Qualifications make a man capable of the ſacred office, <hi>ſine quibus non?</hi> 2. What maketh a man (ſo capable) a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as related to the uncalled world, and the univerſal Church, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged indefinitely to do his beſt for them: and this is Chriſts miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 1. By his Word. 2. And his Spirit giving him a true willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſent. 3. And by authorized ordainers inveſting and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him. 3. What maketh a miniſter to be ſuch a one, as the congregation is bound to conſent ſhall be their proper paſtor? And this is, 1. His ſpecial fitneſs. 2. His ſpecial opportunity. 3. And theſe ſo judged by the Magiſtrate, and Biſhops, or other Paſtors who are meet diſcerners: and if they be peremptory in their impoſition, he hath the greater advantage: In all theſe aforeſaid, the peoples election or conſent is no neceſſary cauſe. 4. What maketh the man and the Church (or any perſon) <hi>in

What is neceſſary to the exerciſe of the office; and that alſo is mutual conſent, as to every proper part, which is a priviledg; which an unwilling perſon can neither have right to, nor poſſeſs, nor uſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ORdination is an outward ſolemn ſetting apart of perſons to the holy miniſtry by prayer and faſting, and the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</p>
               <p>As touching the importance thereof, ſome ſay that it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting or making of a miniſter; others ſay it is the ſolemnizing of his entrance into the office, or his inauguration thereinto, or his inveſtiture therein, and is of the ſame moment to the miniſtry with the ſolemnizing of marriage to the conjugal relation, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of a twig and turf to the poſſeſſion of land Theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways of expreſſion being conſidered, may be found to come to the ſame iſſue; and the latter may ſufficiently ſet forth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a miniſter as far as mans act can make him.</p>
               <p>The words by which that which we call ordination, is ſet forth in Scripture, are, 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Act.</hi> 14 24. which doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily evince an ordaining by ſuffrages, but in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is uſed to ſignifie an ordaining to the office whether by God or man (as hath been before noted): But if the Text were thus to be read, <hi>They ordained them Elders by the ſuffrages of the people;</hi> yet it is plain, that not the people, but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> ordained them. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. Which ſignifies to ſeparate or ſet apart.</p>
               <p>Now the latter way of expreſſing the force of ordination, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſolemn inauguration or inveſtiture in the office, is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of one unto it, or a conſtituting of one in it in that ſence that mans act of ordainining can bear: For it cannot be the act
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64714:36"/>of an efficient cauſe making and giving the office and power thereof: For that (as hath been already ſhewed) is not the act of man, but of Chriſt alone: But it is a neceſſary ordinary ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and that the moſt important, as being the laſt and moſt compleat deſignation made by men of the perſon on whom Chriſt confers the office, and the ſolemn inveſting of him in it.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that tho ordination be ordinarily neceſſary to the miniſtry, yet it is not of that abſolute neceſſity in all caſes, as that there can be no lawful or valid miniſtry without it; for where it cannot be had, there may be otherwiſe a full ſignification of the will of Chriſt, that ſome perſons ſhould do the work of the miniſtry. Moreover the work of the miniſtry is a neceſſary means of ſaving ſouls, of upholding and perpetuating a Church unto Chriſt upon earth, of maintaining ſoberneſs, righteouſneſs and godlineſs of life among profeſſed Chriſtians; and that ſome take this work upon them, is an obligation of the Law of Nature, and indiſpenſable; But regular ordination is but a point of order, and for the interruption or ceſſation of this latter, the former is not to be broken off or ceaſe: And if there be in any an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtatedly to do this work, he is in the office of the miniſtry.</p>
               <p>If any alledg that Chriſt by his law hath made an uninterrupted regular ordination indiſpenſably neceſſary to the miniſtry, he is bound to prove it. If any pretend an uninterrupted regular ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all his predeceſſors, he is bound to make it clear. Chriſt indeed hath inſtituted a miniſtry for the compleating of his church unto the conſummation of all things; he hath alſo promiſed his Apoſtles, and his miniſters ſucceſſively in them, that he will be with them alway to the end of the world: But I find no promiſe of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of regularly ordained miniſters.</p>
               <p>That which is delivered by ordination, is the ſacred miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al office at large as reſpecting the univerſal Church, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed here or there according to particular calls and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

               </head>
               <p>PRAYER is ſuch a duty, as is requiſite to the ſanctifying of all other duties, as the preaching of the Word, adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper; and therefore is neceſſary to this ſacred action of ordaining miniſters. Faſting is a ſervice expreſſive of ſolemn humiliation, and a neceſſary adjunct of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ordinary prayer for the obtaining of more ſpecial mercy, and therefore a neceſſary preparative and concomitant in this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity: And we have Scripture Examples for prayer and faſting in the miſſion of perſons to the work of the miniſtry, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12, 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 14 23.</p>
               <p>What impoſition of hands imports, and the moment of it, is to be conſidered from the uſe of it both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the Old Teſtament 'twas uſed, 1. In ſolemn benediction, the perſon bleſſing laid his hand on the perſon bleſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.14. 2. In offering Sacrifice, as a ſign of devoting it to the Lord by him that offered it, Lev. 1.4. 3. In ordaining to an office as a ſign of ſetting apart therunto, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.18, 20. In the New Teſtament it is uſed, 1. in bleſſing, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16. 2. In curing bodily diſeaſes, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.11. 3. In conveying the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. 4. In ordaining miniſters, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>The meaning of impoſition of hands ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly taken; ſome take it as uſed for the remitting of ſins (as they alſo do 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.) and ſay that Baptiſm refers to the making of proſelytes, and laying on of hands to the abſolving of penitents. Others take it for confirmation. Others conceive that the whole miniſtry is by a <hi>ſynecdoche</hi> therein comprehended.</p>
               <p>From the various uſes of this Rite, we collect, that it was a ſign of conveying a benefit, or of deſigning to an office, or of devoting one to the Lord; and particularly, of authoritative benediction and deſignation to the office of the miniſtry, and of devoting to the Lord in that kind.</p>
               <p>There is no ſufficient reaſon to make it but a temporary Rite, and to limit the uſe of it in ordination only to the times of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eles; there being no circumſtance in any Text to ſhew that it was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64714:37"/>done only for the preſent occaſion. And we read not that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts were given by impoſition of hands in ordination.</p>

               <head>§ 22. <hi>The power of Ordaining belongs to the Paſtors of the Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SOme give this reaſon why the power of Ordination is not in the people, but in the Paſtors, becauſe the act of ordaining is a poteſtative or authoritative miſſion, which power of miſſion is firſt ſeated in Chriſt, and from him committed to the Apoſtles, and from them to the Biſhops or Elders. But this Reaſon muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a grain of ſalt, or in a ſound ſenſe, becauſe Biſhops or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have ſpiritual power <hi>formalier,</hi> but not <hi>efficienter;</hi> and they do not properly make or give the miniſterial power, but are only inſtruments of deſignation, or application of that power to the perſon to whom Chriſt immediately gives it by the ſtanding-act of his Law.</p>
               <p>That the power of ordaining belongs not to the people, but to the Church officers, firſt appears by Scripture-authority, for that in all the New Teſtament there is no example of ordination by any of the Laity, but contrariwiſe it is therein expreſly committed to ſpiritual officers. 2. By Reaſon, for that the Paſtors of the Churches are better qualified for the deſignation of a perſon to the Holy miniſtry, and for performing the action of ſolemn inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture; as alſo, for that ordination includes an authoritative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and that is to come from a Superior, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The leſs is bleſſed of the greater, and not the greater of the leſs,</hi> as it would be if the Paſtor were to be ordained by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are governed by him.</p>
               <p>Some argue for a popular ordination, becauſe election, which is the greater, belongs to the people. But 1. Election is not greater than Ordination in the miniſterial Call. For in ordination, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture in the Function it ſelf is given; but in the peoples election, no more is given than the ſtated exerciſe of the miniſtry in that Congregation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe Election were greater than Ordination, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence holds not. Several parties may have each their own part divided to them; and he that may do the greater, may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do the leſſer, unleſs the leſſer be eſſentially included in the greater, which is not in this caſe.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64714:38"/>
               <p>It is likewiſe urged for popular ordination, That in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the <hi>Levites,</hi> the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> laid their hands upon them, <hi>Numb</hi> 8.11. To this it is anſwered, That the <hi>Levites</hi> were taken by God inſtead of the firſt born of all the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> which the Lord claimed as his own upon the deſtroying of the firſt-born of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and ſo the impoſition of hands by the firſt-born upon the <hi>Levites,</hi> was not ſtrictly an ordaining of them to their office, but an offering of them as a ſacrifice in their own ſtead to make an atonement for them, as he that brought a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, laid his hand on the head of it.</p>
               <p>Tho in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s ordination, the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery be mentioned, and where many Presbyters were, they joined in this action; yet I ſee not any thing in Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to gainſay the validity of ordination by a ſingle Biſhop or Presbyter.

               <head>§ 23. <hi>The Validity of Presbyterian Ordination.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IF a Biſhop and Presbyter of divine inſtitution be the ſame (as hath been before proved) the controverſie about ordination by Presbyters is at an end. And if the Biſhop that now is, be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of officer than the Scripture Presbyter, there is no proof of his divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>That the Presbyter that now is, hath the Paſtoral or Epiſcopal office, hath been already proved by the form of their ordination, and by the nature of that power of the keys that is granted to reſide in them. If the Prelates have inveſted them with an office that is truly Epiſcopal, it matters not whether in expreſs terms they gave them the power of ordaining or no, or whether they expreſly excluded the power of ordaining: for not they, but Chriſt makes the office, and not they but Chriſt gives the power that belongs to the office, from which they cannot detract.</p>
               <p>The ordination of <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to be by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. If it be ſaid that by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery is meant a company of Biſhops; it it granted that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Biſhops were all one. If it be ſaid, they were a company
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64714:38"/>of none but Dioceſan Biſhops, that had ſubject-presbyters of an inferior order under them, let it be proved from Scripture.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by ſome, That only the Dioceſan Biſhops ordain au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, and the Presbyters concomitantly, founding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction on thoſe two Texts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. and 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.14. it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid in the one, That <hi>Timothy</hi> received the gift by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of <hi>Paul</hi>'s hands; and in the other, by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. To this it is anſwered, 1. That the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands mentioned 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. might be in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the firſt receiving of the Holy Ghoſt after Baptiſm, and the following effects of the ſpirit of love, power, and of a ſound mind, argue ſo much. 2. If any of a higher ſtate than Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters laid hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> in his ordination, yet the phraſe of Presbytery argues that they did it as presbyters. 3. If it was <hi>Paul</hi> that ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> authoritatively, and the presbytery but concomitantly, our biſhops cannot thence claim the ſole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative ordination, for <hi>Paul</hi> was of an order above them, and was no otherwiſe a biſhop than as having Epiſcopal power emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently contained in his Apoſtolick office. 4. If the presbytery there mentioned be a company of biſhops of an order ſuperior to presbyters, it will follow by this diſtinction, that ſuch a biſhop ordains not authoritatively but concomitantly. 5. The ſaid Texts afford no ground for the diſtinction of authoritative and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant ordination.</p>
               <p>According to the hierarchical principle, the biſhop is enabled to give orders, not by his power of jurisdiction, but by his power of order. Now a presbyter hath as much of the Character and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of order, as a biſhop; and the conſecration of a biſhop is not held a diſtinct Sacrament of order from the ordination of a presbyter; and the truth is, the form of conſecrating a biſhop according to the Engliſh Ordinal, is expreſſive of no more power of order than is given to the presbyter in the form of his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſaid Ordinal.</p>
               <p>The conjunction of Presbyters with the Biſhop in the preſent form of ordination, ſhews that the order is conveyed by them as well as by the biſhop. Their impoſition of hands is an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative benediction, and dedication of the party ordained. Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtance be produced of the impoſition of hands by any ſuch as had no power of conveying that which was ſignified by that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I mean of conveying it ſo far as mans act can reach unto.

               </head>
               <p>AS Chriſt allows the Church to receive ſuch to Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, as he doth not receive; ſo he allows the Church to call ſome to the Miniſtry, whom he doth not call. For it is his prerogative to be the Searcher of the Hearts, and men can judg but by appearance.</p>
               <p>Such as Chriſt doth not allow the Church to call to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, may by his permiſſion, through the Churches mal-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, be called thereunto; and being ſo called, they abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by his permiſſion, till they be caſt out by due reformation, and ſo long their calling is valid as to external order.</p>
               <p>And ſuch are Miniſters to others, tho not to their own good; and Chrſts ordinances by them adminiſtred are valid and effectual to thoſe intents for which he appointed them. The whole current of Scripture ſhews that Gods ordinances are not made void by the cloſe hypocriſie or groſs impiety of the diſpenſers thereof; and the contrary opinion tends to unchurch Churches, and to deny the Chriſtendom of the Chriſtian World for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>As we muſt diſtinguiſh between miſcarriages in admiſſion, and the nullity of the office, ſo between defects or corruptions in the office it ſelf, and the nullity thereof. The Prieſthood and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was often much corrupted, yet it was true for the ſubſtance thereof; but the Prieſthood appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> was falſe for the ſubſtance, and a nullity.</p>
               <p>Tho the ſacrificing Prieſthood at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> were a nullity, yet the Ten Tribes had the ſubſtance of the true religion, and ſome external acts of worſhip true and valid, as circumciſion, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſomething of a Church. So now among the Papiſts there is the ſubſtance of the Chriſtian Religion, and ſome thing of a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64714:39"/>Church, and Miniſtry, and ordinances. The Miniſtry of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts with reference to the Sacrifice of the Maſs, is a nullity: but as ordained to preach the Goſpel and Baptize, and to any other parts of the proper work of the Miniſtry, it is not a nullity, but their adminiſtration in thoſe things is valid.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MAgiſtratical and Eccleſiaſtical power are in their nature wholly divers; and they are not ſubordinate but collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers; yet Miniſters are ſubject to Magiſtrates, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to Miniſters in divers reſpects, according to the nature of the power that is ſeated in either of them.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtratical power is Imperial, the Eccleſiaſtical is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial; and ſo the paſtor is under the magiſtrate as his Ruler by the ſword, not only in civil, but in ſacred things; and the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is under the paſtor as his Ruler by the word, or his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative teacher.</p>
               <p>The paſtors power over the magiſtrate is no dimunution to his right, for it takes away none of his authoritty, nor doth it hinder the exerciſe and efficacy of it, but it is his benefit, becauſe it is an authoritative adminiſtring to him the mercies of the Goſpel in Chriſts Name; and if he be not under that authoritative adminiſtration, he is not under the bleſſing of the Goſpel. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the paſtoral diſcipline may not be ſo exerciſed towards the ſupream magiſtrate, as by diſhonouring him to make him leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of improving his office to the common good, which the excommunicating of him would do; but if magiſtrates, whether of higher or lower rank, be excommunicated, nevertheleſs they muſt be obeyed.</p>
               <p>The magiſtrates power over the paſtor is no diminution to his ſpiritual authority, for it is not given to hinder but to further the efficacy and exerciſe thereof: So that both powers are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſervative and accumulative, not deſtructive or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>The Church is Chriſts family, and the magiſtrate is not the Lord, but a member of it, and cannot govern it at his pleaſure, but only as the Lord himſelf hath allowed, and the ſtate thereof
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64714:40"/>requires. In ſhort, the magiſtrate as well as the miniſter hath received his authority for ediſication, not for deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The magiſtrate cannot make any new eſſential or integral part of religion either Doctrine of Faith or Divine Worſhip: but he is as much bound up to the religion that is of Gods making, as the meaneſt of his Subjects; for he and they are Gods Subjects both alike: But by his civil ſanctions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may ſtrengthen the true religion, and enforce the obſervance of the Divine Laws, ſo far as it is meet they ſhould be inforced by Humane Laws; and this is the moſt noble part of his work in matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate may and muſt take care that ſacred things be duly adminiſtred by ſacred or ſpiritual officers, and he may and muſt puniſh them for mal-adminiſtration. He may and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain perſons of impious principles from venting their wicked er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and from any open impious practice, by a power formally ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, tho objectively eccleſiaſtical. He may convocate ſynods or councils of eccleſiaſtical perſons to adviſe and conclude according to the Word of God, how the Church being corrupt, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and how to be guided and governed when reformed: And he ought to uſe his own judgment of diſcretion concerning the decrees and judgments of eccleſiaſtical perſons in reference to his own act of political ratifying the ſame.</p>

               <p>He cannot appoint any thing in religion, that is forbidden by the divine laws, nor forbid any thing appointed by the divine laws. All his authority being from God, cannot be againſt him: And therefore ſuch injunctions and prohibitions can lay no obligations of obedience upon the ſubject. Hereupon he cannot forbid the preaching of the Goſpel, or the adminiſtring of Sacraments; for then it were at his pleaſure, whether Chriſt ſhould have a Church or Kingdom upon earth. He cannot take one part of the Paſtors office from him, while he continues him the exerciſe of the other, for that were to maim and marr the office. He cannot deprive a Paſtor of his Paſtoral office, or diſcharge him from fulfilling his Miniſtry, becauſe it is held from Chriſt, and not from him. He
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64714:40"/>may not compel aminiſter to give the Sacraments to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, nor may he compel any to profeſs either in word or deed wha they believe not, or to take that which God hath made the ſpecia priviledg of Believers.</p>
               <p>The accidental parts, modes, and circumſtances of Religion which are neceſſary in general, and left undetermined of God in particular, the Magiſtrate hath power to determine according to the general rules of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as the Divine Law doth conſtitute more particulars, and leaves leſs to humane liberty, and God is more jealous and conſcience more ſcrupulous in ſacred than in common things, it behoves the Magiſtrate to be wary, humble, and ſober in his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations about theſe matters. He may regulate the preaching of the Goſpel, provided that regulation be for the furtherance, not the hinderance thereof: And that can be no part of due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that cauſeth the deſtruction, or dangerous detriment of the thing ordered.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate may not appoint that which is not ſimply for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of God, if it be ſcandalous, or miſchievous in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents; nor may he forbid that which God hath not appointed, but left indifferent, if the omiſſion of it be ſcandalous, or miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in the conſequents; becauſe in ſuch caſes, God hath forbidden the former and required the latter by his general command; and becauſe the Magiſtrate hath his authority (as was ſaid) for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not for deſtruction.</p>

               <head>§ 1. <hi>Of Certainty in general.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Begin the enquiry, by taking notice of the common diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of objective and ſubjective Certainty. Objective Certainty, or Certainty in the object, is the immutable verity of the thing it ſelf. For that a thing is what it is, is unchangeably true. Subjective Certainty is the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of aſſent to a thing apprehended as it is. It is this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I enquire into, and it preſuppoſeth the former.</p>
               <p>It muſt be ſuppoſed that our faculties are true; that is, that in their ſound ſtate, and ſet in due circumſtances, they are adapted to diſcern things as they are indeed. Otherwiſe the queſtion of the nature of Certainty is out of dores, there being no ſuch thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Certainty of Aſſent includes three things: 1. That it be firm, without ſtaggering. 2. That it be true, and not erroneous. 3. That it reſt upon firm and ſure grounds. The firſt is evidently neceſſary, becauſe it is the very notation of the word Certainty; the notion we mean thereby, is not to doubt or ſtagger in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a thing. The ſecond is as evidently neceſſary; for Certainty is an affection of knowledg; but an erroneous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is not knowledg, but ignorance; a confident miſtake can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainty. The third alſo is clear; for if the grounds be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe or weak, the knowledg built thereon cannot be ſure, Tho the aſſent be true in reſpect of the object, yet it is not certain in this caſe, becauſe not judicious nor ſolid; yea, tho the apprehenſion be according to the thing, yet as far as it reſts upon a falſe or weak ground, it is not knowledg properly ſo called, but a caſual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64714:42"/>or preſumption; and when the inſufficiency of the grounds ſhall appear, the apprehenſion fails, and vaniſheth away.</p>
               <p>Meer probability is not Certainty ſtrictly ſo called; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an affection or mode both of knowledg, and of error, which is a kind of ignorance: for that which is only probable, may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, or not be what it is apprehended to be; and ſo the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion thereof may be either true or falſe, either knowledg or error. Yet the apprehending of a probable thing only as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is always a right apprehenſion; for whether the thing be or not be, it is certainly true that it is probable.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of probability lies in a ſufficient evidence that a thing not only may be, but is ſo indeed, rather than not ſo, as it is apprehended to be. The reaſon of Certainty lies in a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence, that a thing muſt needs be as it is apprehended: For if there be not ſuch evidence, then if we indeed conſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we preſently apprehend, that in regard the thing may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it is ſo for ought we know, and that our apprehenſion or opinion about the thing is falſe for ought we know. That there is neceſſarily ſome kind of <hi>needs muſt be,</hi> in the object of a certain, that is, a firm aſſent, ſeems to me to have ſelf-evidence, and to need no proof.</p>
               <p>An Object or Matter of Certainty being that which is in ſome reſpect neceſſary, or that cannot but be ſo, is to be underſtood not only of abſolutely, but hypothetically neceſſary; and of a thing neceſſary not only in regard of eſſence or abſtracted nature, but by neceſſity of exiſtence in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Whatſoever is, whileſt it is, neceſſarily is; and that which hath been, neceſſarily hath been; and that which ſhall be, neceſſarily ſhall be, becauſe it is a contradiction to be and not to be.</p>
               <p>The ſurer the grounds are, and the greater the evidence is in the kind of probability, the nearer it approacheth to certainty; and the weaker the grounds are, and the leſſer the evidence is, the farther it is from it: Therefore very high degrees of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility commonly borrow the name of certainties, and the minds of men do ordinarily reſt therein. The buſineſs of men as to this world generally proceeds upon no better aſſurance, than high degrees of probability.</p>
               <p>Learned men ſpeak of a conjectural certainty or opinion that excludes doubting. I contend not about the name, provided the ambiguity be taken away: If by doubting they mean a fluctuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64714:42"/>or not fixing of aſſent; and by certainty, a fixed aſſent, I grant that in this ſence there is a conjectural certainty, when the mind ſaith undoubtedly the thing is ſo, and reaſon will not ſuffer me to judg otherwiſe: But I judg, that certainty properly ſo called, is an aſſent excluding not only fluctuation, or non fixation or ſuſpence, but alſo an apprehenſion that the thing may be otherwiſe; and it reſts upon no evidence inferior to that which is called demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; an aſſent whereby the mind ſaith not only, I believe that I am not herein deceived; but alſo I believe that I cannot herein be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: For if I believe only that I am not deceived, but not that I cannot be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ceived herein, I am not ſure that I am not deceived herein; for it may be otherwiſe than I apprehend; and for ought I aſſuredly know, it is ſo; and here is no certainty properly ſo called. Note, that when I ſay I can be deceived, I do not mean in every thing, but only <hi>quoad hoc:</hi> For ſpeaking indefinitely, we may truly ſay ſuch a perſon may or can bedeceived; yet it may be true that in this or that determinate caſe, he cannot be deceived. The Apoſtles in their Apoſtolick Embaſſy could not be deceived, yet in common matters they might be deceived like other men.</p>

               <p>LEarned men have diſtinguiſhed Certainty into Moral, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Supernatural. Moral Certainty is by ſome ſet forth to be an undoubted aſſent upon ſuch grounds as are fit fully to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a prudent man Natural Certainty is an aſſent upon ſuch grounds as ſhew, that in nature the thing cannot be otherwiſe than it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Supernatural Certainty is an aſſent upon indubitable ſupernatural evidence.</p>
               <p>As to the aforeſaid deſcription of Moral Certainty by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted aſſent upon ſuch grounds as are fit fully to ſatisfie a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man I conceive it to be not clear enough. For if the grounds upon which the undoubted aſſent is built, be in their own nature and reaſon firm and ſure, then that aſſent is natural Certainty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I find Moral Certainty ſet forth by others, as that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not only heſitation and anxiety, but all apprehenſion that the thing may be otherwiſe, which they call <hi>formidinem oppoſiti;</hi> and this is given as an inſtance of it, that <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time reigned at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now this I take to be all one with Natural Cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ainty; for that the nature or reaſon of the thing ſhews it muſt needs have been, or the grounds of the aſſent thereunto air
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64714:43"/>in their own nature and reaſon firm and ſure, as afterwards ſhall be further ſhewed: But if the grounds of an aſſent be not in their own nature and reaſon firm and ſure, excluding an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the thing may be otherwiſe, that aſſent is no proper certainty at all; as is already ſhewed.</p>
               <p>I grant that a prudent man may and ought to proceed in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs reſpecting this world, upon grounds not properly or ſtrictly certain; becauſe for the moſt part, as well in the greateſt as the ſmalleſt of them, there is contingency: And ſuch matters as have ſtrong probability in them, eſpecially ſuch as are known ſeldome or never to happen otherwiſe, may juſtly beget in men of underſtanding ſuch aſſent or perſwaſion, as they may call, if they pleaſe, a moral certainty, and that which may juſtly remove all diſturbing doubts concerning them; ſo that it would be folly to be interrupted in the courſe of action upon a conceit that they may fall out otherwiſe: Nevertheleſs it is no folly, but a right underſtanding, to conceive that thoſe very matters may fall out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. No prudent man diſturbingly doubts whether any of the perſons this day alive in <hi>London,</hi> will be alive to morrow; yet it is not in the nature of the thing certain, that they will, and therefore no man can rightly judg it to be certain: For the contrary is poſſible to come to paſs, at leaſt in a ſupernatural way; and we have examples of ſuch events, as in the overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in one day by fire from Heaven, and in the ſlaughter of 185000 in the Army of <hi>Senacherib</hi> by an Angel in one night.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that moral certainty (if it may be ſo called) which proceeds upon ſuch grounds as do not exclude <hi>formidinem contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii,</hi> or an apprehenſion that the thing may be otherwiſe, I take to be no certainty properly ſo called: But if any will ſo call a knowledg or aſſent of that nature, I contend not about it. But the term may be taken in another ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for a certain knowledg or aſſent in things of a moral nature, or from moral arguments, in which I judg that certainty ſtrictly ſo taken may be founded: And being ſo taken, it is of the ſame common reaſon with the following kinds of certainty: For it is founded in the nature and reaſon of things moral, as natural certainty in the nature and reaſon of things natural, and ſupernatural certainty in the nature and reaſon of things ſupernatural.</p>

               <p>NAtural Certainty is that which is founded in the nature of things natural, and reſts upon evidence that is ſure in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and fails not. This is twofold; firſt, That which is founded in the ordinary courſe of particular nature. The ſecond, That which is founded in the univerſal and unchangeable reaſon of things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is Certainty founded in the ordinary courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that which reſts upon the nature of things, keeping the natural courſe and ſtate wherein they are ſet by the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So it is naturally certain that the Sun, that is ſet, will riſe again in our Horizon after ſuch a ſpace of time; it is naturally certain, that there will be a viciſſitude of Summer and Winter in our Climate; for that it ſhould be otherwiſe according to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature, or in a natural way, it is impoſſible.

                  </gap>cure Certainty is only of thoſe things which we hold by belief, or opinion, namely, things believed upon divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or humane authority, or inferred from ſigns and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p>But I conceive that to diſtinguiſh Certainty into evident and obſcure, is all one as to diſtinguiſh it into Certain and Uncertain. For evidence is the ground of Certainty; and ſo far as we have certain knowledg of any thing, ſo far we have evidence thereof; and no farther than we have evidence, can we have any Certainty. And it riſes or falls in the degrees of it, according as the degrees of evidence are more or leſs. I take Certainty and Obſcurity to be oppoſite in nature. All Certainty connotes knowledg; Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity belongs not to knowledg as ſuch, but to ignorance; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure knowledg is but knowledg mixed with ignorance.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially I judg it much amiſs to place the certainty of divine faith under the head of obſcure certainty; for that I judg we have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64714:44"/>as good and ſure evidence for the truth of matters of divine faith as for any concluſion of Science, as ſhall be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Howbeit I grant, that things which are moſt firmly and rightly aſſented unto, may be in themſelves obſcure and unſeen; as the matters of the Chriſtian Faith, and the Myſteries of the Goſpel, that are known only by ſupernatural revelation: Yet in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or firm aſſent of the mind about theſe things, there is not obſcurity but evidence, for it reſts upon ſuch grounds as are of clear and evident truth, as is abundantly proved by divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have aſſerted the Divine Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

               </head>
               <p>CErtainty ſtrictly ſo called, doth admit of degrees. A firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent without wavering or doubting, may be more firm. My aſſent to this truth, That there is a God, is firm without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet I may have a greater degree of aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And doubtleſs the Angels that behold the face of God, have a greater Certainty or firmneſs of aſſent to the aforeſaid truth, than mortals upon earth.</p>
               <p>The degree of firmneſs of knowledg or right aſſent, riſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of evidence: I ſay not this of the firmneſs of all aſſent, but of right aſſent, which is knowledg, and in which is true certainty. There may be firmneſs of aſſent, which hath no foundation in the thing it ſelf, and the higheſt confidence in the greateſt miſtake, but no certainty, which always ſuppoſes the true perception of its object.</p>
               <p>That that which is now evident or clearly perceived, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more evident, is a truth which I ſuppoſe cannot be denied: And I think common experience confirms it to every obſerving man, that things ſufficiently or indubitably evident, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made more and more evident. By ſufficient evidence, I mean that which gives us aſſurance that the thing cannot be otherwiſe than we apprehend: There are many divine truths that are now evident, which no true Chriſtian doubts ſhall be made more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in the life to come. What we know here, we know but in part, and not perfectly.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, that that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excels; that is,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64714:45"/>that which poſitively is glorious, comparatively is inglorious: So we may ſay, that which poſitively is evident, comparatively is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. All our preſent evidence of divine truths is but obſcurity in reſpect of the glorious clearneſs that ſhall be hereafter. In like manner the firm aſſent of divine faith may be called weak aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in compariſon of the aſſent of intuitive knowledg in the ſtate of glory. The lower degrees of true knowledg, are ignorance in reſpect of the higher; and the lower degrees of ſtrength and firmneſs ſufficient in its own place, is but weakneſs in reſpect of the higher, eſpecially thoſe tranſcendent degrees in heaven. And where there is not a privative, there may be a negative imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>The Credibility of all teſtimony reſts upon the veracity of the perſon teſtifying, and the evidence of that veracity.</p>
               <p>The higheſt degree of Credibility, and conſequently of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty from teſtimony, is that which reſts upon an immutable ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, which belongs to God alone.

               <p>Tho Gods veracity be a principle by it ſelf evident; yet that this or that teſtimony is of God, may need proof.</p>
               <p>A divine teſtimony may ſo carry its own evidence to the perſon to whom it is immediately made known, as to need no proof thereof; as in voices, and viſions, and inſpirations, tho the way of ſuch ſelf-evidence may be unaccountable by us; nevertheleſs in the caſe of ſuch immediate revelations, ſometimes holy men have without being blamed, asked a ſign for confirmation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God hath without their asking, given a ſign.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HUmane Teſtimony, as ſuch, is not a ground of Certainty ſtrictly ſo called, but at the moſt only of the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conjectural Certainty, that excludes anxiety and fluctuation of mind, but not all apprehenſion that the thing may be otherwiſe. Even the teſtimony of the beſt and wiſeſt of mortal men, can riſe no higher, becauſe there is no mortal man but may deceive, or be deceived.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame reaſon that any one man, or number of men, may deceive, every man, and all men may deceive. Wherefore as the bare teſtimony of one man, or a ſmall number of men by it ſelf conſidered, is not the ground of ſtrict Certainty; ſo neither the teſtimony of any multitudes, or all men by it ſelf conſidered, or meerly as a teſtimony by way of its proper authority.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs with the teſtimony of men there may go along ſuch rational evidence, as may aſcertain the truth of it in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtified, and make it unqueſtionable. And then it is a ground of ſtrict Certainty; not formally and abſtractly, as a teſtimony; but as accompanied with the ſaid Rational evidence.</p>
               <p>This Rational evidence accompanying humane teſtimony, and making it the ground of ſtrict Certainty, is, when there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility evident in Reaſon, that the Witneſſes or Reporters ſhould deceive, or be deceived. He that never ſaw <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> or <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> hath ſtrict Certainty, that thoſe Cities, and thoſe parts of the world have been in being, from the Reports of thoſe that have ſeen them; for it is impoſſible in reaſon that all the Reporters ſhould deceive or be deceived.</p>
               <p>Tho it be poſſible that all the Reporters, conſidered merely as ſo many particular perſons, may lye (for if any one may, all may in that conſideration) yet it is impoſſible that they being ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ſeveral nations, of ſeveral ages, of ſeveral conditions, and ſo of ſeveral intereſts and inclinations, ſhould lye or deceive without detection; for there is no poſſible ſufficient cauſe of ſuch undetected lye; and we know there can be no effect without a ſufficient cauſe.</p>

If there be any ſufficient cauſe of ſuch an undetected lye, it muſt be either a univerſal combination of all the Reporters to deceive, and that combination muſt be held conſtantly; but this is impoſſible: or elſe a concurrent inclination and impulſe in all the Reporters to lye, which is unimaginable, and can have no ſufficient cauſe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe if it be ſuppoſed poſſible that any one perſon through the deception of the ſenſes may be deceived in a matter of fact of palpable evidence; yet it is impoſſible (ſuppoſing our faculties to be true) that all the Reporters ſhould be deceived in matters ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as that there is day and night; that there is a Countrey cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>France, Italy, Greece,</hi> &amp;c. for they could not all be mad or ſenſleſs.

               <p>Now whether this be ſaid to be naturally or morally impoſſible, it comes to one paſs, and gives equal certainty of the teſtimony from the impoſſibility of the contrary part. Beſides, our Arguing ſhews it impoſſible in the reaſon or nature of the thing.</p>

               <p>INFALLIBILITY therefore denoting an impoſſibility of being deceived, and of deceiving, inquire we into the ſubject to whom it doth belong. Some ſay an impoſſibility of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived belongs only to an infinitely perfect underſtanding. We muſt diſtinguiſh between an impoſſibility of being deceived, that is abſolute and unlimited, and that which is hypothetical and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I grant that an abſolute impoſſibility of being deceived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to a finite underſtanding. And no aſſerter of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the creature, intended the former, but the latter kind.</p>
               <p>Hypothetical and limited impoſſibility of being deceived, may belong to a finite, and in particular, to a humane underſtanding, and it is that which ſuppoſeth a full revelation natural or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to the ſubject in whom it is, and is limited to the truth ſo revealed; and this hypothetical infallibility doth not reſt barely upon the perfection of the humane nature, but upon this principle, That God is true in his revelations both natural and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that he doth not govern the world by falſhoods. Now this is proper infallibility: For upon this principle I am not only ſure that I am not deceived; but alſo that I cannot be deceived
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64714:49"/>as to the particular truths ſo evident to me; or to ſpeak it plainer, it cannot be that I am therein deceived, for it were a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that which is certain, is ſo upon neceſſary grounds, and therefore cannot be falſe. And he that knows it to be certain, knows it upon thoſe neceſſary grounds, and conſequently that it cannot be falſe; and this is to know it infallibly. If we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing infallibly, we know nothing either as neceſſary, or as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, whether abſolutely, or hypothetically.</p>

               <p>IT hath been ſhewed, that an underſtanding that is not abſolutely or by the perfection of its nature infallible, may be ſecured from poſſibility of miſtake; and an underſtanding that is not univerſally infallible, may be ſecured from poſſibility of miſtakes, and ſo be infallible in certain caſes, and to certain intents.</p>
               <p>Now it is further to be noted, That there may be a ſtated or permanent Infallibility, and that which is but temporary. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer did belong to the eſtabliſhed Prophets of the Lord in their declarations to his people, and to the Apoſtles of Chriſt in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pertaining to their Apoſtolical Commiſſion for eſtabliſhing the Religion and Churches of Chriſt.

               <p>IT is granted by the deniers of Infallibility, That that which is true, is not poſſible to be falſe. And thence I infer, If I know it to be true, I know it is not poſſible to be falſe, and ſo I infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know it. And my aſſent to a truth (as for inſtance to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64714:50"/>the Chriſtian Faith) cannot poſſibly be falſe.</p>
               <p>Some that ſay, an impoſſibility of being deceived, belongs only to an infinitely perfect underſtanding, do grant that an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable to be deceived, may not be deceived, and be ſure that he is not. And I infer thereupon, that he cannot be deceived in that particular aſſent: I mean not that he cannot ſimply, but in that ſtate and circumſtances, wherein he is put, he cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived therein; and that he knows he cannot, becauſe he knows it implies a contradiction that he ſhould be deceived in that wherein he is ſure that he is not deceived: For if I may be deceived in ſuch an apprehenſion or aſſent, not only ſimply, but all circumſtances being put, I cannot be ſure that I am not deceived therein.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe thoſe that ſay an impoſſibility of being deceived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to an infinitely perfect underſtanding, do grant, that a man cannot be deceived in that thing, with the belief whereof God inſpires him, and gives him ſuch evidence thereof as cannot be falſe. Now this is a conceſſion of hypothetical and limited inſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to humane underſtanding: For it is here acknowledged, that there may be ſuch evidence of divine inſpiration, as cannot be falſe: And indeed I take it for a repugnancy in nature, that God ſhould inſpire the belief of a falſhood. Nevertheleſs a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired is not ſimply infallible in his apprehenſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration; for he may ſometime be deceived in thinking he is ſo inſpired, when he is not.</p>
               <p>Thus it being evident, that an underſtanding, that is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply infallible in a matter, may in the ſtate and circumſtances wherein he is put, be therein infallible; I think it better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and limit the term and notion of infallibility in the humane underſtanding, than wholly to reject it. But howſoever, they that reject or diſlike it, do grant and contend for a ſufficiently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin evidence of truth; and I will not quarrel if that will ſerve for infallibility.</p>
               <p>And they will alſo grant, that they who are not immediately inſpired of God, have ſufficiently certain evidence in reaſon to the diſcerning and chuſing of infallible guides that are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inſpired.</p>

               <p>Whereupon I conclude, that though infallibility in its formal reaſon admits of no degrees, yet there are different degrees of the evidence, and the clear apprehenſion thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreover infallibility is in a more noble and perfect ſtate in one ſubject, than in another. And ſo the infallibility of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior intellect, as that of Angels, is in a more perfect and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than the hypothetical, and the unlimited than the limited.</p>
               <p>In the ſame ſubject infallibility may be in a more perfect ſtate at one time than another, according to the riſing or falling of the evidence thereof.</p>

For that the one ſhould be falſe, and that the other ſhould be true, implies a contradiction, ſuppoſing the ſenſitive faculty to be true.

               <p>Not only Mathematical, but Logical, Phyſical, Moral and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Concluſions, admit of demonſtrative evidence.</p>
               <p>Whereas ſome ſay, the exiſtence of God is not Mathematically demonſtrable, becauſe only Mathematical matter admits ſuch kind of evidence; if it be meant of that ſpecial evidence that is in the Mathematicks, it is nothing to the purpoſe; but if it be meant of evidence in general, as demonſtrative as Mathematical evidence, it is falſe: for this Truth admits the cleareſt and ſtricteſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition, That God is, is demonſtrative in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe by a demonſtration <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> viz of the neceſſary cauſe from the effect; it being evident, that the exiſtence of God is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the exiſtence of the World, for that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attribute the being of the <hi>Phanomena</hi> or viſible things in the world, to any other cauſe than ſuch a Being as we conceive God to be, but we muſt offer violence to our own faculties.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition, That every word of God ſhall be fulfilled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true and full intent of it, is demonſtrative in the ſtricteſt ſenſe <hi>a priori,</hi> from the veracity of God; it being as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that God is true, as that he is.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We may infallibly know the Chriſtian Doctrine to be of God by his unimitable image or impreſſion which is upon it, ſuppoſing the truth of the hiſtorical part. Likewiſe the truth of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical part, namely, that this doctrine was delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and that thoſe things were done by him and them, which the Scriptures mention, we may know infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles and other firſt witneſſes knew it infallibly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their preſent ſenſe and reaſon, with the concomitance of ſupernatural help in remembring and atteſting it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Churches received the Teſtimony from the firſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes upon naturally certain and infallible evidence, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that thoſe witneſſes could by combination deceive the world in ſuch matters of fact in the very age and place, when and where the things are pretended to be done and ſaid: And theſe Churches had the concomitance of ſupernatural atteſtation in themſelves by the ſupernatural gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and by miracles wrought by them.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians or Churches of the next age received the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from thoſe of the firſt with a greater evidence of natural infallible Certainty; for that the Doctrine was delivered to them in the records of ſacred Scripture, and both the miracles and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters were more numerous, and they were diſperſed over much of the world: and with theſe alſo was the ſupernatural evidence of miracles.</p>
               <p>We of the preſent age receive it inſallibly from the Churches of all precedent ages ſucceſſively to this day by the ſame way, with greater advantages in ſome reſpects, and with leſſer in others; not upon the Churches bare authority, but the natural Cerainty of the infallible tradition of the Holy Scriptures or records of this religion, and of the perpetual exerciſe thereof according to thoſe records in all eſſential points, wherein it was naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the precedent ages to impoſe falſhoods upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent: And this rational evidence of the Churches tradition was in conjunction with the hiſtories of heathens, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Churches enemies, infidels and hereticks, all which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64714:52"/>did acknowledg the verity of the matters of fact.</p>
               <p>There is natural evidence of the impoſſibility, that all the witneſſes and reporters, being ſo many, of ſuch condition, and in ſuch circumſtances, ſhould agree to deceive, and never be detected; for there is no poſſible ſufficient cauſe that ſo many thouſand belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and reporters in ſo many ſeveral countries throughout the world ſhould be deceived, or be herein mad or ſenſleſs; and that thoſe many thouſands ſhould be able in theſe matters unanimouſly to agree to deceive more than themſelves into a belief of the ſame untruth in the very time and place where the things were ſaid to be done: And no ſufficient cauſe can be given, but that ſome among ſo many malicious enemies ſhould have detected the deceit, eſpecially conſidering the numbers of Apoſtates, and the contentions of Heriticks.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, there is a ſucceſſion of the ſame ſpirit of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, which was in the Apoſtles and their hearers, continued to this day, and is wrought by their Doctrine.</p>

               <p>AS we may be infallibly certain of the Divine Authority of the Holy Scripture, ſo likewiſe of the ſence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at leaſt in points fundamental or eſſential to the Chriſtian Religion, and that without an infallible Teacher.</p>
               <p>We may certainly know, that an interpretation of Scripture repugnant to the common reaſon of mankind, and to ſenſe right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumſtantiated, is impoſſible to be true; if we can certainly know any thing is impoſſible to be true; and conſequently we may infallibly know it.</p>
               <p>The ſence of Scripture in many things, and thoſe moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to Chriſtian faith and life, is ſo evident from the plain, open and ample expreſſion thereof, that he that runs may read it, if his underſtanding be notoriouſly prejudiced: And if we cannot know the ſaid ſenſe to be neceſſarily true, we can know nothing to be ſo, and ſo we are at uncertainty for every thing.</p>
               <p>It will ſurely be granted by all, that we may as certainly know the ſenſe of Scripture in things plainy and amply expreſſed, as the ſenſe of any other writings, as for inſtance of the Writings of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi> in the definitions and axioms in which men are univerſally agreed.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64714:53"/>
               <p>If any ſay the words in which the ſaid definitions and axiomes are expreſſed, may poſſibly bear another ſenſe, it is anſwered, That they may, abſolutely conſidered; becauſe words which have their ſenſe <hi>ad placitum,</hi> and from common uſe, being abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may have a divers ſenſe from what they have by common uſe; but thoſe words being reſpectively conſidered as ſetled by uſe, cannot poſſibly bear another ſenſe, unleſs we imagine the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt abſurdity imaginable in the Writer. Beſides, they that pretend the poſſibility of another ſenſe, I ſuppoſe do mean ſenſe, and not nonſenſe. And how a divers ſenſe of all thoſe words in <hi>Euclide,</hi> that is not pure nonſenſe, ſhould ariſe out of the ſame words, and ſo conjoined, is by me incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>But if the poſſibility of the thing be comprehenſible, or ſo great an abſurdity be imaginable in a Writer led only by a humane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is not imaginable in Writers divinely inſpired. That the Holy Ghoſt ſhould write unintelligibly, and wholly diverſly from the common uſe of words in things abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>If an infallible Teacher be neceſſary to give the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all things, and no other ſenſe than what is ſo given, can be ſafely reſted in, then either the right ſenſe of that infallible Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers words, if he be at a diſtance, cannot be known but by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent infallible Teacher, or elſe that pretended infallible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is more able or more willing to aſcertain us of his meaning, than the Holy Spirit of God in Scripture.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak of ſeeking the meaning of Scripture from the ſenſe that the Catholick Church hath thereof, is but vain talk. For firſt, the Catholick church never yet hath, and never is like to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the day of judgment, to declare their ſenſe of the things in queſtion; nor have they written it in any book or number of books. 2. Never did any true Repreſentative of the Catholick Church, or any thing like it, as yet come together, or any way declare what is their ſenſe of the Scripture, and the things in queſtion; nor is ever like to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Tho it be granted that the Catholick Church cannot err in the eſſentials of Chriſtian Religion, as indeed no true member thereof can (for it would involve a contradiction); yet there is no aſſurance from Scripture or Reaſon, but that a great, if not the greater part of the Catholick Church may err in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals, much more in the accidentals of Religion; yea, there is no aſſurance from Scripture or Reaſon, but that the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64714:53"/>Church may err at leaſt <hi>per vices</hi> in the ſeveral parts thereof, ſome in one thing, ſome in another; And all this is teſtified by experience in the great diverſities of opinions about theſe things, in the ſeveral parts of the Catholick Church; yea, and by the difference of judgment and practiſe of the larger parts thereof, even from thoſe among us who hold this principle of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtanding to their judgment.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſhall we think that God puts men upon ſuch diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, yea, impoſſibilities of finding out the true meaning of the Holy Scriptures, at leaſt in the main points of Chriſtianity? Surely God requires of us no more than he hath given, and that is to make uſe of the faculties wherewith he hath indued us. How can we apprehend any doctrine, or the ſenſe of any written word, but by our faculty of underſtanding? And how can we make judgment thereof, I mean a judgment of diſcretion, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of our own reaſon?</p>
               <p>This is not to ſubject matters of Religion to a private Spirit, but to refer them to the Divine Authority of Scripture, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the right and due uſe of reaſon, which is a publick and evident thing, and lies open to the trial and judgment of all men.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THUS upon the grounds before laid we may have a natural infallible Certainty of the verity of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the divine authority of the Scripture, and of the ſenſe of Scripture. It remains to be conſidered, Whether the having of this Certainty both of the Chriſtian Religion, and of the Scripture, be neceſſary to the being of ſaving Faith.</p>
               <p>Here let it be noted, That a perſon may have ſome doubting of a matter, whereof he ſees no juſt cauſe of doubting: And howſoever men may poſſibly argue againſt this aſſertion, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience makes it good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there is ſufficient reaſon for it in the infirmity of our minds contracted by the fall, whereby oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are confident of the things, which we ſee we have juſt cauſe to doubt of, or disbelieve; and whereby we doubt of the things, that we ſee we have juſt cauſe moſt firmly to believe. I take this to be evident in that ſaying, <hi>I believe, Lord help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief:</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64714:54"/>And againſt this it cannot be ſaid, here is an effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſufficient cauſe; for tho there be no ſufficient ground or reaſon of the doubt; yet, for it being a defect, there is a ſufficient cauſe, namely, the infirmity of the mind.</p>
               <p>He that ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>I believe, Lord help mine unbelief,</hi> had ſaying faith: And his faith that he profeſſed, and his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that he complained of, appears by the context not to relate to his intereſt in Chriſt, but to Chriſt himſelf, as able to help him; And ſo from this inſtance it is evident, that the not having of an infallible certainty of the object, denies not the being of ſaving faith, at leaſt, where a man is ſo far clear, as to ſee no juſt cauſe of doubt, tho he do ſomewhat doubt.</p>
               <p>A man that ſees not a ſufficient evidence to be infallibly aſſured touching the firmneſs of the grounds for the receiving of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and yet ſees no ſufficient evidence for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of that doctrine, may from the conſideration of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the things therein treated of, and the probability of the truth of thoſe things, be induced intirely and heartily to imbrace that doctrine, with purpoſe to live accordingly, and to perform that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That this may be, is evident; for humane prudence doth ſtrongly oblige a man in that caſe to make ſuch a choice for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and if he doth not make ſuch choice, he doth not act with the underſtanding of a man. But if it be ſaid, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane nature would be too hard for humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the caſe: I anſwer, That God can give that aſſiſtance of his Grace, whereby a mans will ſhall be inabled to make its choice according to prudence, againſt its naturally corrupt inclination: And God can give this aſſiſtance very congruouſly, or agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his holy Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever in the caſe aforeſaid doth make ſuch a choice, and live accordingly, hath ſaving faith: For his ſo doing doth imply an unfeigned love to, and preferring of God, and Chriſt and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, above all that is in the world, and ſo muſt needs ſuppoſe faith unfeigned; and God proceeding according to his Grace in Chriſt, will not impute unto condemnation ſuch a ones culpable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Certainty in the matters of Faith, which doth not hinder his ſincere truſt in God through Chriſt, and his intire and hearty love to him.</p>

               <p>IT may laſtly be inquired, What Certainty one may have of his being in the ſtate of grace? As for the Certainty of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is a different inquiry, and depends on another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touching the Certainty of perſeverance in a juſtified ſtate, which is not here to be medled with; and we inquire not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one may be certain of his being in the ſtate of Grace by ſpecial revelation, but in an ordinary way.</p>
               <p>That any one ordinarily ſhould have certain knowledg of his being in the ſtate of Grace, ſuppoſeth his certain knowledg of theſe two things. 1. That God hath declared in his word that they which have ſuch and ſuch qualifications, are in the ſtate of Grace. 2. That he himſelf is ſo qualified; For it is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe two premiſes, the one whereof is the object of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith, and the other of a clear and right ſelf-knowledg. The Certainty of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath declared perſons ſo qualified to be in the ſtate of Grace, none deny, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Certainty of Chriſts Goſpel. The Certainty of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the matter of debate, whether it be poſſible, and whether it ought to be had.</p>
               <p>It is not inquired, Whether the Certainty of the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the perſon himſelf be ſo qualified, be a Certainty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith: For the object of ſuch Certainty is only what God hath revealed, that this or that man hath faith and repentance, but this is only a point of ſelf-knowledg.</p>
               <p>Here interpoſe we ſomething of the doctrine of Proteſtants and Papiſts about the Certainty of this matter.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants in aſſerting, that the Certainty of being in the ſtate of Grace, is a Certainty of divine faith, do mean no more, but that one of the propoſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> Whoſoever unfeignedly believes, is juſtified, reſts ſolely on the Word of God; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> I unfeignedly believe, is known by internal ſence, and experience. But whether the concluſion, Therefore I am juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in the ſtate of Grace, be rightly called a concluſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith, I leave to others to judg, not caring to ſtrive about words, when the thing it ſelf is agreed upon: And doubtleſs no ſober Proteſtant will aſſert that the Certainty which we have of this concluſion, is a Certainty of the ſame reaſon, with that which we have of an article of faith, either ſo firmneſs or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:64714:55"/>
               <p>The Papiſts in denying the Certainty of Juſtification to be a Certainty of Divine Faith, do not deny all Certainty thereof; but mean that it is not of the ſame reaſon with the Certainty which we have of an Article of Faith: Becauſe, tho one of the premiſes on which it is founded, be an Article of Faith, yet the other is known but by internal ſence, and the teſtimony of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>As to the later of the premiſes, which is known but by internal ſence and experience, conſider we whether a man may and ought to have a Certainty therein, and of what ſort it is. On the one hand, doubtleſs it is not ſuch a Certainty as expels all fear of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: On the other hand, it is doubtleſs ſuch a Certainty at leaſt, as expels anxiety, and is ſufficient to ſettle the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And I think in this both Papiſts and Proteſtants do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>There is a Certainty that expels all apprehenſion that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be true, whereof this is an inſtance, That there were ſuch perſons as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Julius Ceſar:</hi> and this hath gained the name of moral Certainty, tho I think it may be called natural, as grounded on naturally certain evidence: And that a man may have ſuch a Certainty of his unfeigned faith, is held by Proteſtants in general, and ſome Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Papiſts in general grant not this kind, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a lower kind of Certainty hereof, which they call conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: yet they tell us, that it is certainty truly ſo called, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels fluctuation and ſuſpence, and brings peace, and joy, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and withal they ſay, that the Juſt believe indeed, that they are not herein deceived, but not that they cannot be deceived: But how this lower kind can be certainty properly ſo called, I ſee not; For an apprehenſion that the thing is otherwiſe than I think, excludes all Certainty properly or ſtrictly ſo called.</p>
               <p>The above ſaid moral Certainty of juſtification, or being in the ſtate of Grace, is not attained by all juſtified perſons; and where it is attained, it is not ordinarily continued without interruption, nor ordinarily in the ſame degree, becauſe juſtified perſons, even the beſt of them, do not continue without interruption in the ſame degree of faith and holineſs, on the internal ſenſe whereof this Certainty depends.</p>

               <head>§ 1: <hi>What was anciently a Biſhops Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Name Church is the firſt and only Scripture-name properly belonging to a Biſhops charge. In the beginning of Chriſtianity, Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had their Churches in Cities or Towns: And commonly the Converts of the Adjacent Villages were by reaſon of their paucity taken in as parts of the City Congregation, and all made but one particular Church, the members whereof had local Communion with each other: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the name of city applied to a Biſhops charge, could be but extrinſecal, it being not the name of the thing it ſelf, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the place where it was congregate. The name of Pariſh came next in uſe for the ſaid charge; And this name is ſtill in uſe for a particular Church or Congregation, which hath its proper and immediate Biſhop or Paſtor. The word Dioceſs, as relating to a Biſhop, was unknown for ſeveral ages of Chriſtianity; but afterwards it was borrowed from civil uſe, and applied to the Church. A Dioceſs was one of the larger diviſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and comprehended ſeveral Provinces. Accordingly when
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64714:56"/>it was firſt applied to the Church, it was uſed for the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit; and as a Province was the charge of a Metropolitan, who had many Biſhops under him; ſo a Dioceſs was the charge of a Patriarch, who had many Metropolitans under him: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſence there was a Canon made to forbid the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for ordination, without the Dioceſs, that is, without or beyond the foreſaid patriarchal circuit. But the uſe of the word for the charge of ſuch a Biſhop, as had no Biſhops but only Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters under him, came up in latter times.</p>
               <p>From the firſt and only Scripture-name properly belonging to a Biſhops charge, it is inferred, that a Biſhop and a particular Church are correlates. A particular Church as ſuch, hath its own proper Biſhop; and a Biſhop as ſuch, hath his particular Church, as his proper and immediate charge.</p>
               <p>The biſhops Church was anciently but one ſociety Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which might and did perſonally meet together at once, or by turns, for Worſhip and Diſcipline under the ſame immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; which appears by the proofs here following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the members thereof, even men ſervants and maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as well as others, might and ſhould be known by name to the biſhop. <hi>Ignat. Ep.</hi> to <hi>Policarp. Id. ad Trall.</hi> In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick of <hi>Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tyre, Euſeb. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. It is ſaid, 'Tis the work of a biſhop to be intimately acquainted with the minds and ſtates of every one of the flock, when by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and time he hath made inquiry into every one of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One Church had but one Altar, and conſequently but one ſtated aſſembly for full Communion. <hi>Ignat. Ep. ad Philadelph.</hi> To the Presbyters and Deacons my fellow ſervants. If one biſhop muſt here be taken numerically, ſo muſt one altar. The Apoſtles Canons, c. 5.32. make it appear there was but one altar and one biſhop, with the Presbyters and Deacons, in a church. Alſo Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>Antiochen.</hi> c. 5. Hereupon Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, that before dioceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were divided into pariſhes, they had not only one altar in one church or <hi>dominicum,</hi> but one altar to a church, taking church for the company or corporation of the faithful united under one biſhop or paſtor, and that was in the city or place where the biſhop had his Sea or Reſidence. Add hereunto, that to ſet up another altar, was accounted a note of ſchiſm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Each ſingle church had its proper and immediate biſhop. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. ad Philad.</hi> as before; to every church one altar, one biſhop.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64714:56"/>He ſhews alſo, that without a biſhop, the ſtate of a church exiſts not, <hi>Ep. ad Smyrn.</hi> Whereſoever the biſhop appears, there is the church; as whereſoever Jeſus Chriſt appears, there is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick church. A particular church was then no larger than that where the biſhop appeared. <hi>Id. ad Trall.</hi> The biſhop is a type of the higheſt father; and the Presbyters are as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of God, and the bond of Apoſtolical concord, <hi>Ib.</hi> Be ſubject to the biſhop, likewiſe to the presbyters and deacons. This ſhews that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and presbyters were together in one and the ſame particular church, and jointly took the immediate charge of the flock.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some of the Ancients teſtifie, that the Apoſtles placed <hi>only</hi> biſhops without presbyters, in ſome churches. <hi>Epiphan. Hereſ.</hi> 65.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning the largeneſs of a biſhops church, let that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> be conſidered. He was made bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> when he had but ſeventeen Chriſtians; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when many were converted at <hi>Comana,</hi> a ſmall town that was near, he did not make it a part of his own dioceſs, but ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alexander</hi> the Collier, a right worthy perſon, to be their bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. And they were of no greater number than what met to chuſe him, and hear him preach.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ordinary work of a biſhop, ſhews that it was but one ſingle church that he had charge of. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſetting forth the manner of the church aſſemblies, tells us, that the Preſident himſelf preached, gave thanks, adminiſtred the Euchariſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed diſcipline. <hi>Tertullian de corona Militis,</hi> c. 3. ſaith, <hi>We take the Sacrament of the Euchariſt from the hand of no other than of the Preſident.</hi> It is to be noted, that in thoſe times they received the Sacrament at leaſt every Lords day. And it is confeſſed by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Divines, that this Preſident was the biſhop. But if any ſay that he was a meer presbyter, they muſt grant that a presbyter had the name of Preſident, and a governing power.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is much aſſerted among the Hierarchical Divines, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently biſhops only were allowed to preach. And if this was ſo, it was and could be but one ſingle church that a biſhop had as his immediate charge; for we cannot imagine that there were chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which ordinarily had no preaching, or in which preaching was not ordinarily allowed; yea, the presbyters might not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize without the biſhops command or conſent. This ſhews that each particular church had its proper biſhop.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64714:57"/>
               <p n="8">8. That church in which divine worſhip was performed, had alſo diſcipline exerciſed in it, <hi>Tertul. Apol.</hi> c. 39.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The biſhops church was no greater than that all the people could meet together and chuſe their biſhop. In <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, at the ordaining of a biſhop, the next biſhops came to the people, for whom the biſhop was to be ordained, and every one was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his converſation, <hi>Cypr.</hi> lib. 1. Ep. 4. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> Edit. to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> a presbyter. <hi>Nor let the people flatter themſelves as free from the contagion of the ſin, when they communicate with a prieſt that is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner—They ought to ſeparate themſelves from him, ſeeing they chiefly have the power either of chuſing worthy, or refuſing unworthy prieſts. Sacerdotal Ordinations ought not to be made, but under the conſcience of the aſſiſting people.—The cuſtom is with us, and almoſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all provinces, That to the celebrating of Ordinations, all the next b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſhops of the ſame province aſſemble with the people to whom the</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus <hi>is ordained.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe we find much in very many of his Epiſtles. This was the ordinary courſe of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for all the people to chuſe their biſhops, and to be preſent thereat; for which a multitude of teſtimonies may eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Apoſt. Can.</hi> c. 5. ſhew, that the biſhop with his presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and deacons lived on the gifts of the ſame altar. 'Twas the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of biſhops and their presbyters to dwell together, and be in common.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The numerouſneſs of the ancient biſhops and their churches, ſhew, that thoſe churches were of no large extent. In the firſt council of <hi>Carthage</hi> it was decreed, c. 11. That for examining eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary cauſe of an accuſed presbyter, ſix biſhops out of the neighbouring-places were to hear and determine; and for every cauſe of a deacon, three biſhops.</p>
               <p>It is reported that <hi>Patrick</hi> planted in <hi>Ireland</hi> three hundred ſixty five churches, and as many biſhops. In the <hi>Vandalick</hi> perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſix hundred and ſixty biſhops fled out of one part of <hi>Africa,</hi> beſides all that were murthered, impriſoned, and tolerated. Many proofs hereof might be alledged; but in general it ſufficeth to note, That a great number of biſhops could on a ſudden meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Provincial Aſſembly, as in the ſixth council of <hi>Carthage</hi> two hundred and ſeventeen biſhops were met. And in the times of perſecution under the heathen Emperors, there were numerous Aſſemblies of biſhops when they went in fear of their lives.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:64714:57"/>
               <p n="12">12. The paucity of Presbyters in a Biſhops Church ſhews that it was not very large. In greater Churches they had a greater number of presbyters, but in ſmaller they had often two, ſometimes one, ſometimes none.</p>
               <p>The matter here conſidered, touching the ancient form and ſtate of a biſhops Church, will be further cleared in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sections.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THAT every City, which had a competent number of Chriſtians, had a biſhop with his Church, is granted on all ſides: And that it was not a biſhops ſeat which made that a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which otherwiſe would not have been ſo, but that every Town or Burrough was a City receptive or capable of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, cannot reaſonably be denied. The Scripture uſeth the word City for any Town or Burrough, Mat. 12.25. Mat. 23.34. Luk. 2.3. Luk. 7.11. Act. 15 21. <hi>Crete,</hi> which was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, could not have a Hundred cities in it, unleſs ſuch as our Burroughs; and in every ſuch city the Rule was to ordain elders or biſhops, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>What argument from Scripture, or reaſon, can be brought, why <hi>Worceſter, Gloceſter, Chicheſter,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be made Cities and ſeats of Biſhops, rather than <hi>Shrewsbury, Ipſwich, Blimouth,</hi> &amp;c? In the firſt ages of the Chriſtian Church all Towns were Cities to this intent without any difference; Yea any places of greater confluence of people were in the ſame capacity of having Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophilus Alexandrius Epiſt. Paſcal. in Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> 3 <hi>Tom.</hi> mentions Biſhops in very ſmall Cities. <hi>Zozomen</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Spiridion</hi> was biſhop of the Town <hi>Trimethus,</hi> and ſaid to be Keeper of ſheep in that Town after he was biſhop.</p>
               <p>There is alſo ſufficient proof that biſhops were ordained in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, or in places that were no Cities. <hi>Majuma</hi> was the port of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and becauſe it had many Chriſtians, it was honoured by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with the name of a City, and a biſhop of its own: And when <hi>Julian</hi> in malice took from it the honour of being a City, it ſtill kept its own biſhop; tho it had the ſame Magiſtrates
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64714:58"/>and Military Governours with <hi>Gaza:</hi> And when the biſhop of <hi>Gaza</hi> ſought to ſubject the Clergy of <hi>Majuma</hi> to himſelf, ſaying, 'twas unmeet that one City ſhould have two biſhops, a Councel in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> called for that purpoſe, confirmed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Majuma, Sozomen.</hi> l. 5. cap. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was but a Port of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as <hi>Pyraeus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> yet we find a Church conſtituted there, Rom. 16.1. They who ſay it was a pariſh ſubordinate to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> having only a presbyter aſſigned to it, are bound to prove it. <hi>Clemens</hi> Apoſtolical conſtitutions, lib. 7. c. 84. ſaith, that <hi>Cenchrea</hi> near <hi>Corinth,</hi> had <hi>Lucius</hi> a biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sozomen</hi> l. 7. c 19. ſaith, when throughout <hi>Scythia</hi> there are many Cities which have all one biſhop, there are other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where biſhops are ordained in villages, as among the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Cyprians, and Phrygian Montaniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Counccil of <hi>Sardica,</hi> Can. 6. it was decreed, that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops may not be ordained in villages or in ſmall cities, where one presbyter will ſuffice, leſt the name and authority of a biſhop ſhould become vile: But this was done in the middle of the fourth Century, and the decree implies, that till then biſhops had been allowed in villages and ſmall Cities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> were placed in country villages, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians grew ſo numerous as to have Churches in them: and this proves that the Churches then kept in a narrow compaſs.

Epiphanius,</hi> hereſy 68, concerning <hi>Meletius,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Alexandria</hi> had not anciently two Biſhops as other Cities had. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Hippo</hi> in the days of <hi>Valerius,</hi> and joined with him as his colleague in the Epiſcopal function. <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 34. to <hi>Paulinus:</hi> And ſome learned men of the hierarchical way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time, the one of the Circumciſion, and the other of the Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was the firſt that decreed, that univerſally there ſhould be but one biſhop in a City, <hi>Can.</hi> 8. If any that come from the <hi>Novations</hi> to the Catholick Church be a biſhop, let him have the dignity of Prieſthood, unleſs it pleaſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick biſhop to give him alſo the honour of the Epiſcopal Name: If it doth not pleaſe him, let him find a place for him, that he may be a <hi>Chorepiſcopus</hi> in the pariſh, or a presbyter in the Clergy, that there may not ſeem to be two biſhops in one City.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Catalogues of the ancient biſhops in great Cities, wherein the ſucceſſion is by one ſingle perſon after another. It may be conſidered, That Hiſtorians being of later ages, had reſpect to the cuſtom of their own times, wherein the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy reſided in one: And when anciently there were two or more equal in the name and authority of a Biſhop, the ſurvivor was reckoned the ſucceſſor, whenas he was indeed but the ſurviving colleague: Some do thus labour to remove the contradictions of Hiſtorians touching the order of the ſucceſſion of the firſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome, Linus, Cletus, Anacletus,</hi> &amp;c. by ſuppoſing that theſe or ſome of them were presbyters or biſhops at the ſame time, ruling that Church in common, and that the following wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fancying to themſelves ſuch biſhops as were ſet up in the Church in their times, fell into thoſe diverſities of tradition.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> diſcourſe 5. on 1 Cor. 4 1. ſaith, there are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but two orders Eccleſiaſtical, Presbyters and Deacons, the reſt are but divers degrees of theſe two.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> opinion concerning biſhops and presbyters, is thus declared in his Annotations on Acts 11. Altho the Title of Elders hath extended to a ſecond order in the Church, and now is in uſe only for them; yet in the Scripture-times it belonged principally, if not alone, to the biſhops, there being no evidence that any of that ſecond order were then inſtituted in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Now if in Scripture-times presbyters of an inferior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to biſhops were not inſtituted (as this learned man ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) it is evident, that all thoſe Church-officers called presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, mentioned in Scripture, were biſhops; and if this inferior order of presbyters be not to be found in Scripture, I deſire to know, what proof can be made of its divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Many, if not moſt, Papiſts acknowledg, that presbytery is the higheſt order in the miniſtry, and that Epiſcopacy is but a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degree of the ſame order: And it is no reſolved point of faith among them, whether biſhops differ from presbyters only in degree, or in order and office.</p>

                  <p>As concerning that paſſage, p. 7. <q>To the High Prieſt, proper miniſtrations were appointed; to the prieſts their own place was aſſigned; and upon the <hi>Levites</hi> their proper miniſtry lay, and the Laick man bound to Laick precepts.</q> I conceive that it alone affords no argument for three Orders of miniſtry, or eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially different offices in the Goſpel-church. For it reſpects the preſent matter but only in way of ſimilitude, and no more is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby, than as under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy there were ſeveral orders, and ſeveral miniſtrations pertaining to them, ſo it is alſo in the Goſpel-church; but it may not be uſed in argumentation beyond what is plainly deſigned in it; much leſs may it be urged to prove any thing contrary to the tenor of the whole Epiſtle; beſides the High-prieſts office was not of another kind from the prieſts, but a higher degree in the ſame office for ſome particular mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which alſo in time of his incapacity might be ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily performed by another prieſt. And let the compariſon be forced to the utmoſt, it will ſhew no greater difference between a biſhop and a presbyter, than between an Archbiſhop and an ordinary biſhop.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>Grotius</hi> his argument, That this Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, becauſe it no where makes mention of that exceſſive autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which began to be afterwards introduced, or was at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by the cuſtom of that church after the death of <hi>Mark,</hi> and in other places by that example.

                  <p>From theſe citations it is evident, that this Father doth expreſs one and the ſame order of Epiſcopacy in all presbyters.

And that the presbyters made the biſhop, is an argument brought by him to prove the identity at firſt, and afterwards the nearneſs of their power.

Why, but becauſe there is one ordination of a biſhop and presbyter; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is a prieſt, but the biſhop is the firſt: every biſhop is a presbyter, but every presbyter is not a biſhop; for he is a biſhop who is firſt among the presbyters.</q> Here note, that the difference lies in this, that the biſhop is the firſt among the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THAT Presbyters have the power of the keys, and that the Apoſtles received it as Presbyters, is commonly agreed on all ſides. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his form of primitive Government and Right of Churches, <hi>p.</hi> 128. ſaith, That the power of the keys, that is, the power of the Church, whereof that power is the root and ſource, is common to biſhops and presbyters. Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> in his Apology, Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> and many others, ſay much more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Presbyters have the power of juriſdiction and diſcipline, particularly of excommunication and abſolution. <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> proves, that the power of excommunication and abſolution is not different from the power of the keys, which is exerciſed <hi>in foro poenitentiali,</hi> and is acknowledged to belong to presbyters, <hi>L.</hi> 5, <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 48, &amp;c. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Heliodor,</hi> ſaith, <hi>If I ſin, a presbyter may deliver me to Satan.</hi> In the Church of <hi>England</hi> a presbyter is ſet to paſs the ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Chancellors Court, tho he doth but ſpeak the words when the Court bids him. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology c. 59. ſaith, that <hi>probati quique ſeniores,</hi> all the approved <hi>Elders</hi> did exerciſe diſcipline in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus Strom. l.</hi> 7. ſaith, that in the Church the presbyters keep that diſcipline which makes men better. <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 44. With the order of presbytery they keep the doctrine of the Apoſtles ſound, and their converſation without offence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the information and correction of the reſt. This place ſhews, that diſcipline for correction as well as doctrine for information, did belong to the presbyters. <hi>Epiphanius haereſ.</hi> 42. reports, that <hi>Marcion</hi> was expell'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> presbyters, the Sea being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. <hi>Id Hereſ.</hi> 47. That <hi>Noetus</hi> was convicted, judged, and expelled by a ſeſſion of presbyters. Many Dioceſſes have been long without biſhops upon ſeveral occaſions, and governed all that time by presbyters. <hi>Vid. Blondels Apol.</hi> ſect. 3. p. 183, 184. The Church of <hi>England</hi> allows presbyters in the Convocation to make Canons. Alſo it allows presbyters to keep perſons from the Communion of the Church for ſome offences, and to receive them
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64714:64"/>again if they repent. To ſay that the presbyters cannot exerciſe this power without the biſhops conſent, doth not derogate from the truth of their power herein; for in ſome ancient times it was ſo ordered, that presbyters could perform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſacred miniſtrations without their biſhop. They might not baptize (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) without the biſhops command; but that limitation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected only the exerciſe of the power, but not the power in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Presbyters have power of ordaining, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. The Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> had not many Prelates at that time, if any; but the prophets and teachers there are mentioned as Ordainers. Whereas ſome ſay they were biſhops of many Churches in <hi>Syria;</hi> they ſpeak without proof, and againſt the text, which ſaith, there were in the church that was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> certain prophets and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which clearly expreſſeth, that they all belonged to that Church: this right of presbyters is confirmed by the paſſages before cited, concerning the ordaining and making the biſhops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the presbyters of that Church. <hi>Firmilian</hi> in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Ep. 75. ſaith of them that Rule in the Church, that they have the power of baptizing, of laying on of hands, and ordaining; and who they be, he expreſſed a little before, <hi>viz.</hi> Seniors and <hi>Praepoſiti,</hi> by which the presbyters as well as the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are underſtood. <hi>Foeliciſſimus</hi> was ordained a deacon by <hi>Novatus,</hi> one of <hi>Cyprians</hi> presbyters, ſchiſmatically; yet his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination was not nulled by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but he was depoſed for mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration. The firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> in their Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all the Churches of <hi>Egypt, Libia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> thus determine concerning the presbyters ordained by <hi>Meletius [Socrat. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6.] <hi>Let thoſe that by the grace of God, and helped by our prayers, are found to have turned aſide to no ſchiſm, but have contained themſelves within the bounds of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolick Church, free from ſpot of error, have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ordaining Miniſters, and alſo of nominating thoſe that are worthy of the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. Now tho they had not this power granted them to be exerciſed apart without their biſhop; yet it is to be noted, that they had the power, tho the Biſhop as preſident guided in all thoſe acts. The Author of the Comment on the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that goes under the name of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſaith, That in <hi>Egypt</hi> the presbyters ordain <hi>(conſignant)</hi> if the biſhop be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Alſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> faith, that in <hi>Alexandria</hi> and all <hi>Egypt,</hi> if the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64714:64"/>biſhop be wanting, the presbyters conſecrate. Presbyters ſent bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops into <hi>England,</hi> and ordained biſhops for <hi>England.

               <head>§ 8. <hi>Teſtimonies in reference to the Biſhops Plea of being the Apoſtles Succeſſors.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FOR the diverſity of order between a biſhop and a presbyter, it is alledged, That biſhops are the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, which presbyters are not. To this it is anſwered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ancient Fathers make presbyters as well as biſhops, the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lib. 4. c. 43, 44. <q>We muſt obey the presbyters that are in the Church, even thoſe that have ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, who have received the certain gift of truth according to the pleaſure of the Father, with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Epiſcopacy.</q> Here presbyters are ſaid to have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles, and to have ſucceſſion of Epiſcopacy. This cannot be evaded by ſaying, he intended it only of presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a ſuperior order, which are biſhops: for this is to beg the queſtion; and in this Father there is no footſtep of any order of presbyters but what are biſhops. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> l. 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 9. <q>The Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons muſt remember, that the Lord choſe Apoſtles, that is, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and <hi>Praepoſiti;</hi> but after the aſcenſion of the Lord, the Apoſtles made deacons to themſelves, as Miniſters of their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy and the Church.</q> Now in the names of Biſhops and <hi>Praepoſiti,</hi> the presbyters are included (as I have before made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt). And it is plain that in this place, all in the ſacred Miniſtry above Deacons, are included in thoſe names, and called Apoſtles. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Heliodor,</hi> ſpeaks in general, that Clericks are ſaid to ſucreed the Apoſtolical degree. The late form of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Church of <hi>England, viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Receive the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſins thou doſt forgive, they are forgiven; and whoſe ſins thou doſt retain, they are retained; and be thou a faithful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> is for the former part, the very form of words uſed by our Saviour to his Apoſtles, to expreſs their Paſtoral Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and fully proves, that the office of a presbyter is Paſtoral, and of the ſame nature with that which was ordinary in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and in which they had ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some conceive there is no proper ſucceſſion to the Apoſtles, whoſe office, as to its formal ſtate, and ſpecifick difference, was extraordinary, and expired with their perſons. And in proper ſpeaking, the ordinary Biſhops or Elders cannot be reckoned the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64714:65"/>ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, for they were contemporary with them in the firſt planting of the Churches, and did by divine right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and exerciſe their governing-power, which the Apoſtles did not ſupercede by their preſence, tho it were under the regulation of their ſupereminent authority; and the Biſhops or Elders of all ſucceeding ages, are properly the ſucceſſors of thoſe firſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. <hi>Bellarmine l.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. c.</hi> 25. ſaith, That biſhops do not properly ſucceed the Apoſtles, becauſe the Apoſtles being not ordinary, but extraordinary Paſtors, have no ſucceſſors; and that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> properly ſucceeds <hi>Peter,</hi> not as an Apoſtle, but as an ordinary paſtor of the whole church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas ſome ſay, That the Order of biſhops began in the Apoſtles, and the order of presbyters in the ſeventy diſciples: it is anſwered, 1. As concerning the biſhops order, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeak of Apoſtles or Evangeliſts long reſiding in one church, they did by way of ſimilitude call them biſhops thereof. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> againſt <hi>Hart,</hi> ſaith, That the Fathers when they term an Apoſtle the biſhop of this or that City, mean in a general way, that he did attend that Church for the time, and ſupply that room in preaching which the biſhop afterwards did. And not only the Apoſtles, but itinerant Miniſters or Evangeliſts, were in ſuch a general ſence biſhops of the places where they came. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtaid at or about <hi>Epheſus</hi> three years, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.31. yet he was not biſhop there in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe of the word. <hi>James</hi> was either no biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or no Apoſtle, but as many think, another <hi>James.</hi> 2. As concerning the order of inferior preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ſaid to be inſtituted in the ſeventy diſciples, it is ſpoken without proof, and againſt Reaſon. <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> ſaith, thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty had but a temporary commiſſion, and therefore that he cannot affirm that Presbyterial Order was directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſtituted in them, <hi>de Rep. Eccleſ. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 4. <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> acknowledgeth, that the ſeventy diſciples were Evangeliſts, <hi>de Miniſt. Evang. grad. c.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>TImothy</hi> was not a fixed biſhop. His travels we find upon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Record. When <hi>Paul</hi> went from <hi>Beraea</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64714:66"/>left <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> behind him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.14. Afterwards they coming to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens, Paul</hi> ſent <hi>Timothy</hi> thence to <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> to confirm the Chriſtians there, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>An.

Thence he returned to <hi>Athens</hi> again, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſent him and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> thence into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Acts 18.5. and thence they returned to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth, An.</hi> 48. Afterwards they travel to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> whence <hi>Paul</hi> ſent <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> into <hi>Macedonia, Acts</hi> 19.22 whither <hi>Paul</hi> went after them, <hi>An.</hi> 51. from <hi>Macedonia</hi> they with divers brethren journied into <hi>Aſia, Acts</hi> 20.4. and come to <hi>Miletum,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> ſent to <hi>Epheſus</hi> to call the elders of the Church, <hi>An.</hi> 53. Then <hi>Paul</hi> did not leave <hi>Timothy</hi> as Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but took him with him in his journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Rome:</hi> for thoſe Epiſtles which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote while he was priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> bear either in their inſcription, or ſome other paſſage, the name of <hi>Timothy,</hi> as <hi>Pauls</hi> companion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and to <hi>Philemon. Pauls</hi> beſeeching of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to abide ſtill at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. had been needleſs, if he were then a ſetled biſhop there. Beſides, it is granted, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he was with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Miletum;</hi> yet that Church had then elders, which the Holy Ghoſt had made Biſhops. Therefore it cannot be, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was the firſt Biſhop that ever <hi>Epheſus</hi> had, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs is affirmed in the Poſtſcript of the ſecond epiſtle to <hi>Timothy. Spalatenſis,</hi> lib. 2 c. 3. n. 60. ſaith, That without doubt <hi>Timothy</hi> was a General biſhop, that is, an Apoſtle tyed to no ſeat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Titus</hi> was no fixed Biſhop. His travels we likewiſe find up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſacred record. <hi>Paul</hi> made him his companion in his journey to <hi>Jeruſalem, Gal.</hi> 2.1. <hi>An.</hi> 43, 45. <hi>Paul</hi> returning to <hi>Antioch,</hi> paſſed through <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> confirming the Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.41. from <hi>Cilicia</hi> he paſſed to <hi>Creet,</hi> where having preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and planted a Church, he left <hi>Titus</hi> for a while to ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the things that were left undone, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>An.</hi> 46. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins <hi>Titus</hi> to come to him to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> where he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Winter, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.12. <hi>an.</hi> 51. but changing his purpoſe, he ſent for him to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where his Winter-ſtation was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. thence he ſent him to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to enquire of the ſtate of that Church. His return from thence, <hi>Paul</hi> expected at <hi>Troas;</hi> and becauſe there he ſound not his expectation anſwered, he was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64714:66"/>in ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. Thence <hi>Paul</hi> paſſed into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where <hi>Titus</hi> met him, and brought him the glad tidings of the gracions effect which his firſt Epiſtle had wrought among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5, <hi>&amp;c. an.</hi> 52. <hi>Paul</hi> having collected the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Saints, ſends <hi>Titus, an.</hi> 53. again to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to prepare them for that contribution, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. And we do not find, that after his firſt removal from <hi>Creet,</hi> he did ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither. After this we read, that <hi>Titus</hi> was with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and went thence not to <hi>Creet,</hi> but to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. It is to be noted, that after the time of <hi>Titus</hi> his being in <hi>Creet,</hi> was the greateſt part of his travels. And if <hi>Titus</hi> did abide ſome years in <hi>Creet,</hi> that doth not declare him to be a fixed biſhop there; for unfixed Miniſters were not ſo obliged to perpetual motion, but that they reſided long in one place, according to the work to be done there, as <hi>Paul</hi> abode three years at <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> jointly, theſe following things may be obſerved: In the New Teſtament there is no inſtance of a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Overſeer or Paſtor, whoſe motion was ſo planetary as theirs; and there is no evidence that afterwards they return'd to reſide at <hi>Epheſus</hi> or <hi>Creet:</hi> it is granted by the aſſertors of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> that they were not biſhops till after <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt being at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now the firſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> were written by <hi>Paul</hi> before his firſt going to <hi>Rome;</hi> and his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written at his firſt being at <hi>Rome, Vid. Ludov. Capellus Hiſtor. Eccleſ.</hi> p. 66, 74. All that aver <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be biſhops, borrow their teſtimony from <hi>Euſebius;</hi> and all that he ſaith, is only that it is ſo written; and he had this ſtory from the fabulous <hi>Clemont,</hi> and from <hi>Egeſippus,</hi> who is not extant.

And the name of <hi>Phrygia Pacatilana</hi> was not in uſe in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, nor till the more declining time of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</hi> In the poſtſcript of the ſecond <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> theſe words, <hi>ordained firſt biſhop,</hi> &amp;c. is not in many ancient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> nor in the Vulgar edition, nor in the <hi>Syriack</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. The <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> was not written from <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> as the poſtſcript ſaith; for had <hi>Paul</hi> been there, he would have ſaid, I have determined <hi>here,</hi> not <hi>there</hi> to winter. And whereas it faith <hi>the firſt biſhop,</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi> or his <hi>Penman</hi> mind the notifying of a ſucceeding biſhop, and the diſtinguiſhing of <hi>Titus</hi> from him in this <hi>Epiſtle?</hi> Moreover biſhop of the Church of the <hi>Cretians,</hi> is not the ſtile of a biſhop of a Dioceſs, who hath ſome City, and not a whole Region for his Sea. <hi>Creet</hi> is ſaid to have had a hundred Cities in it, and <hi>Titus</hi> was directed by <hi>Paul</hi> to ordain elders or biſhops in all thoſe Cities that had Chriſtians. And the Scripture way of expreſſion would be, not the Church, but the Churches of the <hi>cretians;</hi> (Church) being uſed of a City with its adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Villages; and (Churches) of a Region or Countrey of ſuch a circuit as <hi>Creet</hi> was. Thus there is good ground to think, that the poſtſcripts are of much later date than the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The precepts given by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> are either ſuch as concern all presbyters, or ſuch as are above the biſhop of a particular church. 1. Some precepts given them, concern all presbyters. To be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, belongs to all preachers of the Goſpel. As a biſhop muſt be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince gainſayers, ſo ought all presbyters. The ſtopping of the mouths of ſubverters, is by conviction, and extends as well to doctrine, as to definitive ſentencing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.34. and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive ſilencing was anciently by presbyters, either alone, or in conjunction with their biſhops. The authority given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> That thoſe who ſin, be rebuked before all, belongs to presbyters, and it is that which may be done by equals. To lay hands ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on no man, concerns presbyters, to whom belongs the power of laying on of hands. Nor doth this precept infer, That a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath power to ordain alone; and it is granted that one bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop alone may not ordain a biſhop. Presbyters as well as biſhops were concern'd in that precept, of not receiving an accuſation ſuddenly againſt any. And in ancient times, if a biſhop or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter were accuſed, the matter was referred to a Synod conſiſting
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64714:67"/>of biſhops and presbyters. Other precepts given them, were above the proper work of a biſhop of a particular Church. To erect and govern Churches in a hundred Cities, and to govern ſuch presbyters, who, according to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> were biſhops, belonged not to an ordinary biſhop of a particular Church. Wherefore this latter ſort of duties belonged to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> as Evangeliſts, or General Miniſters, who had a kind of Vice-Apoſtolick office; of which ſort were <hi>Barnabas, Silas, Apollos, Titus, Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and others.</p>

That the name Angel may be taken collectively, not individually. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Homily on the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.</hi> on theſe words, <hi>I will remove thy Candleſtick,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>John</hi> calls the Church the Angel. As the Civil ſtate of the <hi>Pagano</hi>-Chriſtian Empire is called the Beaſt, and the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate, the Whore; ſo Angel may ſignifie the whole Presbytery, but put in the ſingular number, to hold proportion to the ſeven ſtars, which ſignifie the ſame thing, and the ſeven Candleſticks. In theſe Epiſtles to the Churches, there are indications, that not a ſingle perſon, but a company is repreſented under this name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10, 16, 24, 25. 3. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, that this Angel was only <hi>praeſes.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he to whom the title of biſhop was appropriated by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, was the Preſident of the presbytery. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> c. 3. ſaith, He is the biſhop who is firſt among the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. This priority or preſidency is in Hiſtory obſerved to have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64714:68"/>begun firſt at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the people whereof above other men were given to ſchiſm and ſedition, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith of them, <hi>l:</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>If this preſidency began at</hi> Alexandria <hi>upon the death of</hi> Mark, <hi>it muſt needs be long before the death of</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Apoſtle. Howbeit, <hi>Clement</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch a priority or preſidency of one above the reſt in that Church. And <hi>Jerome</hi> having mentioned <hi>John</hi> as the laſt of the Apoſtles, ſaith that afterwards one was ſet over the reſt. Now whereas <hi>Jerome</hi> called the imparity of biſhops and presbyters, an Apoſtolical tradition, it is to be noted that with him an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical tradition, and Eccleſiaſtical cuſtome, are the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the main thing ſtill remains unproved, for ought that is to be gathered from this title of Angel, or from any thing contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe Epiſtles to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, namely, that theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (whatſoever they might be) were biſhops of a ſuperior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than that of presbyters, or that they had a ſuperiority of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the presbyters, or that they were biſhops ſet over divers ſetled Churches, or fixed Congregations, with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, or that they had the ſole power of juriſdiction and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The main point in controverſie is not, Whether biſhops, but whether ſuch as the preſent Dioceſan biſhops, have continued from the Apoſtles times to this Age.</p>
               <p>The ancient biſhop was the Officer of a particular Church, not a general Officer of many Churches He was not a biſhop of biſhops; that is, he did not aſſume a power of ruling biſhops who have their proper ſtated Churches. <hi>Cypr.</hi> in <hi>Conc.

            <head>The Preſent Eccleſiaſtical Government, compared with the Ancient EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPACY.</head>
            <p>IT is commonly objected againſt the Nonconformiſts, That they are enemies to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and that they renounce the Ancient Government received in all the Churches. The truth of this Objection may eaſily be believed by thoſe that hear of <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> and conſider only the name thereof, which hath continued the ſame till now, but not the thing ſignified by that name, which is ſo changed, that it is of another nature and kind from what was in the firſt Ages. There be Nonconformiſts, who think they are more for the Ancient <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> than the Aſſertors of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Hierarchy are; and who believe they are able to make it evident, may they be permitted. Something to this purpoſe is here in a ſhort Scheme tendered to conſideration, and proof is ready to be made of each particular here aſſerted, touching the ſtate and practice of the Ancient Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN the firſt ages, a Political Church conſtituted as well for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Diſcipline, as for Divine Worſhip, was one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Society of Chriſtians, having its proper and immediate bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or biſhops, paſtor or paſtors. In theſe times the loweſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Church, is a Dioceſs uſually conſiſting of many hundred pariſhes, having, according to the Hierarchical principle, no bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop but the Dioceſan. Yet theſe pariſhes being ſtated eccleſiaſtical Societies, having their proper paſtors, are really ſo many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the firſt Ages, the biſhops were biſhops of one ſtated Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Society, or particular Church. But in the preſent age,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64714:69"/>biſhops that are of the loweſt rank, according to the Hierarchical principle, are biſhops of many hundred churches, which kind of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop the ancient churches did not know, and which differs as much from the ancient biſhop, as the General of an Army from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a ſingle Company.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The biſhop of the firſt Ages was a biſhop over his own Church; but he was not a biſhop of biſhops; that is, he was not a Ruler of the Paſtors of other Churchs. But the preſent biſhop, even of the loweſt rank, according to the Hierarchical principle, is a biſhop of biſhops, namely, of the presbyters of his Dioceſs, who are the proper and immediate Paſtors of their ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and really biſhops according to the true import of that name and office, as it is in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they be not biſhops, are not of the ſame order with the presbyters mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture; for all presbyters therein mentioned, were bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops truly and properly ſo called. Now if they be not of the ſame order with the Scripture presbyters, they are not of divine, but meerly humane inſtitution: but if it be acknowledged that they are of the ſame order, (as indeed they are) why are they denied to be biſhops of their reſpective Charges? And why are they bereaved of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> or paſtoral Authority therein?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The biſhops of the firſt Ages had no greater number of ſouls under their <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> than of which they could take the perſonal overſight. But the preſent biſhops have commonly more ſouls under their <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> than a hundred biſhops can perſonally watch over. The ordinary work of the ancient biſhop, was to preach, give thanks, adminiſter the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> pronounce the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and exerciſe diſcipline to the people under his charge. But the biſhops of the preſent age, neither do nor can perform theſe miniſtries to the people that are under their charge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ancient biſhop did exerciſe his <hi>Epiſcopa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> perſonally, and not by Delegates or Subſtitutes. But the preſent biſhop doth for the moſt part exerciſe it not perſonally, but either by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, who have no <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> authority of themſelves, but what they derive from him alone; or by Subſtitutes, whom he accounts no biſhops.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ancient biſhops did not govern alone, but in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the presbyters of his Church, he being the firſt presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſtiled the Brother and Colleague of the presbyters. But
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64714:69"/>the preſent biſhop hath in himſelf alone the power of juriſdiction both over the Clergy and Laity.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ancient biſhop did not, and might not ordain Miniſters without the counſel of his Clergy. But the preſent biſhop hath the ſole power of ordination. Tho ſome presbyters whom he ſhall think fit, join with him in laying on of hands, yet he alone hath the whole power of the act without their conſent or counſel.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To labour in the word and doctrine, was anciently the moſt honourable part of the biſhops work, and it was conſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him in his particular Church or Congregation. But now preaching is not reckoned to be the ordinary work of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and many biſhops preach but rarely and extraordinarily.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The ancient biſhops were choſen by all the people, at leaſt not without their conſent, over whom they were to preſide. And when a biſhop was to be ordained, it was the ordinary courſe of the firſt ages, for all the next biſhops to aſſemble with the people for whom he was to be ordained, and every one was acquainted with his converſation. But the preſent biſhops entrance into his office, is by a far different way.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Anciently there was a biſhop with his Church in every City which had a competent number of Chriſtians. But in the later times many, yea moſt Cities have not their proper biſhops (I mean biſhops in the Hierarchical ſenſe) tho they be as large and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as thoſe that have. It is to be noted, that the manner was not anciently as now, that a Church and its biſhop did cauſe that to be called a City, which otherwiſe would not be ſo called; but any Town-corporate or Burrough was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a City, according to the ancient uſe of the word.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Becauſe in the firſt ages the Chriſtians of a City, and its adjacent Villages, did ordinarily make up but one competent Congregation; There was commonly but one Church in a City, and that City-church took in all the Chriſtians of the adjacent Villages, who were but one ſtated Society, all the members whereof might have perſonal communion one with another. But the dividing of the biſhops Cure into ſuch parts as are now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pariſhes, came not in till long after the Apoſtles times; and when that diviſion firſt took place, they were but as Chappels of Eaſe to the City-church. Here it is to be noted, That till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s time it cannot be proved that there were above four or five Churches in all the world that conſiſted of more people than
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64714:70"/>one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pariſhes, nor of half ſo many as ſome of them.</p>
            <p n="13">13. In the beginning of Chriſtianity, Cities or Towns were judged the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itteſt places for the conſtituting of Churches, becauſe in them the materials of a Church, to wit, believers, were moſt numerous, and in them was the greateſt opportunity of making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore Converts, with other advantages which the Villages did not afford. Yet when the number of Chriſtians encreaſed in a Region, Churches having their proper Biſhops, were conſtituted in Villages, or places that were not Cities; one proof whereof is in the <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> who were biſhops diſtinct from ordinary presbyters. Thus it was in the firſt ages. But in the following times, when the worldly grandure of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was riſing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e contemptible.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Tho it hath been decreed by Councils, That there be but one biſhop in a city, and the cuſtom hath generally prevailed; yet there in manifold proof, that in the firſt ages more biſhops than one were allowed at once in the ſame city, yea in the ſame church. Indeed the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians now extant, being compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively but of later ages, and having reſpect to the government of their own times, ſet down the ſucceſſion of the ancient biſhops by ſingle perſons; whereas ſeveral biſhops preſiding at the ſame time, the ſurviving and moſt noted Colleague was reckoned the Succeſſor.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The ancient biſhops exerciſed diſcipline in a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and by arguments deduced from it, ſought to convince the judgment, and awe the conſcience, according to the true nature of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſcipline. But the preſent biſhops have their Courts, which are managed like Secular Courts, to compel men to an outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their decrees, by the dread of temporal penalties annexed to excommunication.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The preſent biſhops ſay of their Church-government, that without ſecular force none would regard it. But the ancient biſhops thought it a reproach to Chriſts diſcipline to declare to the world, that it is a powerleſs thing of it ſelf, and inſufficient to obtain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> unleſs the temporal ſword inforce it.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Epiſcopal or Paſtoral authority is now commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by a Lay-chancellor; and tho an ordinary prieſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64714:70"/>in the Court to ſpeak the words of excommunication, yet the Chancellor as Judg decrees it. And excommunications and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions paſs in the biſhops name and authority, when he never had the hearing of the cauſe: but anciently it was not ſo. In this caſe I enquire, Whether Chriſt hath authoriſed any biſhop to delegate his Epiſcopal power to a Lay-man, yea, or to a Clergy-man, if that Clergy-man be not as Chriſts commiſſioned Officer, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to exert that power?</p>
            <p n="18">18. The ſentence of excommunication is denounced for any non obſerva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of the judgment of the Court, tho in caſes of doubtful right, and in the ſmalleſt matters. But no proof of ſuch practice can be produced from the firſt ages. And let the biſhops themſelves judg, howſoever contempt may be pretended in the caſe, Whether many who are uſually ſo ſentenced either upon doubtful or trivial matters, do indeed deſerve to be adjudged to ſuch a ſtate as that ſentence duly adminiſtred doth import?</p>
            <p n="19">19. The Pariſh Miniſter is bound to denounce in his Church the ſentence of Excommunication decreed by the Court, tho he have no cognizance of the cauſe, and tho he know the ſentence to be unj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt. But no ſuch practice was known in the ancient church.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Miniſters at their Ordination receive that Office which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially includes an Authority and Obligation to teach their flocks; yet they may not preach without a licenſe from the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in their own proper charges or cures, tho they perform other Offices of the Miniſtry. But anciently it was not ſo.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The preſent biſhops require of their Clergy an Oath of Canonical obedience; but let any proof be given that the ancient biſhops did ever impoſe ſuch an Oath, or that the presbyters ever took it.</p>
            <p n="22">22 The Pariſh miniſter hath not the liberty of examining whether the Infant brought to Baptiſm be a capable ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is, Whether he be the child of a Chriſtian or Infidel; but he muſt baptize the child of every one that is preſented by Godfathers and Godmothers, who commonly have little or no intereſt in the Infant, nor care of its education, and who not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are but Boys and Girls.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Confirmation is to be adminiſtred only by the biſhop; and yet it is in an ordinary way impoſſible for him to examine all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be confirmed by him within his Dioceſs. Conſequently it cannot be duly adminiſtred to multitudes of perſons that are to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64714:71"/>be preſented thereunto; and they that are confirmed, are few in compariſon of thoſe that are not. But the ancient biſhops being biſhops of one particular Church, were capable of taking the overſight of every particular perſon of their flocks, and did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally perform the ſame.</p>
            <p n="24">24. A great part of the adult members of Pariſh-churches, are ſuch as underſtand not what Chriſtianity is; but the ancient churches were careful that all their members might be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently knowing in the Religion which they profeſſed, as appears by their diſcipline towards the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and the long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they admitted them to baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="25">25. The Pariſh miniſters have no remedy, but to give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to ignorant and ſcandalous perſons that offer themſelves thereunto; they can but accuſe the openly wicked in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors Court, and but for one time deny the Sacrament to ſome kind of notorious ſinners; but then they are bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them in the Court, and to procure a ſentence againſt them there, where not one notorious ſinner of a multitude is or can be brought to a due tryal, in regard of the way of proceeding in Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and the multitude of ſouls in every Dioceſs. The conſequent hereof is the general intruſion of the groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and profane, who pollute the communion of the Church, and eat and drink damnation to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="26">26. All pariſhioners that are of age, are compelled to receive the Sacrament, how unfit or unwilling ſoever they be, by the terrors of penalties ſubſequent to excommunication; and thoſe that have been excommunicated for refuſing to receive, are abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that ſentence, if being driven thereunto they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament rather than lye in Gaol. And the Pariſh-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are compelled to give the Sacrament to ſuch.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Many Orthodox, Learned, and Pious men, duly qualified for the Miniſtry, are caſt and kept out of it for not declaring an unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all and every thing contained in the Liturgy and Book of Ordination. Let any proof be given that ever any of the ancient Biſhops or Churches thought all the points contained in thoſe books ſo neceſſary to be aſſented and conſented to, or that any of them ſo ſeverely required the like conformity to opinions, forms and ceremonies of the like nature and reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:64714:71"/>
            <p n="28">28. The preſent biſhops debar all Chriſtians from the Lords Supper who through unfeigned ſcruple of conſcience refuſe to kneel in the act of receiving the Sacramental bread and wine; and they debar from baptiſm the children of thoſe Parents who judg it unlawful for them to permit the ſigning of their children with the ſign of the Croſs. But the ancient biſhops did not ſo, nor doth the practiſe of Antiquity warrant the ſame.</p>
            <p n="29">29. The greateſt ſeverity of the preſent Church-diſcipline, is directed againſt Miniſters and people who obſerve not full confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Rules, Forms, Rights, and Ceremonies preſcribed in the Liturgy and Canons. But the ancient biſhops exerciſed it againſt thoſe who ſubverted the Chriſtian faith by damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, or enormouſly tranſgreſſed the Rules of ſoberneſs, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and godlineſs, preſcribed of God in his word.</p>
            <p n="30">30. The Oath impoſed upon the Church-wardens to make their Preſentments according to the Book of Articles framed by the biſhop, hath had this conſequence (which ought to be laid to heart) that commonly they would rather overlook their Oath, than become accuſers of their honeſt neighbours; not only thoſe who withdraw from, but thoſe who hold communion with the Pariſh churches.</p>
            <p n="31">31. The requiring of the reordination of thoſe miniſters, who have been ordained by presbyters, is contrary to the practiſe of the ancient Church; it contradicts the judgments of many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent biſhops, and other Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have maintained the validity of Presbyterial ordination; it nullifies the miniſtry of all the Foreign Reformed Churches, and of moſt, if not of all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> churches; and it advances the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> above them; for the prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon their converſion are received without reordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereas thoſe that come from the Foreign Reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, muſt be reordained before they be admitted to the miniſtry in the church of <hi>England.</hi> And all this is done, when in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the office of a biſhop and presbyter is one and the ſame, and the difference between them came in afterwards by Eccleſiaſtical cuſtome.</p>
            <p>It is commonly ſaid, That Churches and Biſhops being now delivered from their ancient low and diſtreſſed ſtate under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and perſecution of the Heathen powers, and enjoying the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64714:72"/>patronage and bounty of Chriſtian Rulers, ſhould not be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their ancient meanneſs, narrowneſs and weakneſs, but be enlarged in opulency, amplitude, and potency, anſwerable to the Civil State.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is freely granted, that the ſtate Eccleſiaſtical ſhould in reaſonable proportion partake of the proſperity of the Civil ſtate. But the queſtion ſtill remains.</p>

               <hi>A Conſideration of the preſent ſtate of Conformity in the Church of</hi> England.</head>
            <p>IN conſidering the terms of Conformity now injoined, I am not forgetſul of the reverence due to Rulers. I do not herein preſume to judg their publick acts, but I only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a judgment of diſcretion about my own act in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their injunctions, which ſurely they will not diſallow. To conſider the lawfulneſs of thoſe things, of which an unfeigned approbation is required, is an unqueſtionable duty. If I ſhould profeſs what I believe not, or practice what I allow not, my ſin were heinous and inexcuſable. The Reaſons of my diſſent are here expreſſed as inoffenſively as can be done by me, who am to ſhew, that it is not nothing for which I have quitted the ſtation which I formerly held in the Church. I have no reaſon nor will to lay a heavier yoke upon my ſelf than the Law doth, or to ſet ſuch bars in my own way as the Law doth not. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admit that more reſtrained ſenſe of the Declaration which is thought by many to make the enjoined terms more eaſie. I am concerned to take notice of ſmaller as well as greater matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as well the one as the other are alike to be owned. Tho I would not differ with the Church about little things, yet I may not profeſs an allowance of any little thing, which I believe is not allowable. I deſire to proceed in this enquiry with good judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to do nothing weakly; but however it be, I had rather be thought to be injudicious and overſcrupulous in making obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, than want a ſufficient clearneſs in a buſineſs of this nature. I take no pleaſure in making objections againſt the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, but I do it by conſtraint, that I may give an account of that Nonconformity to which by an irreſiſtible force of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I am neceſſitated. If all things contained and preſcribed in the ſaid book, be right and good, I heartily wiſh that I and all men were convinced of it. I joyn with the Congregation in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64714:73"/>uſe of the Liturgy, and I acknowledg that by joyning in it, I declare my conſent to the uſe of it, as in the main an allowable form of Worſhip. But this doth not (as I ſuppoſe) ſignifie my allowing of all things therein contained.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Declaration of unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent required by the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</head>
               <p>THE true intent of this Declaration is to be conſidered. By the form of words wherein it is expreſſed, it ſeems to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no leſs than aſſent to, and approbation of the whole, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing contained and preſcribed in and by the Book of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that no man can make this Declaration, that is not ſatisfied of the truth of every thing contained, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and allowableneſs of every thing preſcribed in the ſaid book. Nothing is more evident to me, than that I ought not to diſſemble or lye in matters of Religion; but ſo I do, if I declare my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to thoſe things contained and preſcribed in the Liturgy, from which I really diſſent.</p>
               <p>But this meaning thereof is not acknowledged by many and very judicious perſons among the Conformiſts. They grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the words will not only bear this ſenſe, but would ſeem to incline to it, if the meaning of them were not evidently limited by the Law it ſelf, and that in the very clauſe wherein it doth impoſe it. That the Law doth expreſly determine this aſſent to the <hi>uſe</hi> of the Liturgy, they ſay is evident from theſe words, <hi>He ſhall declare his unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the uſe of all things in the ſaid book contained and preſcribed, in theſe words, and no other:</hi> I <hi>A. B.</hi> do here declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now by all rules of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting laws, we are directed (ſay they) to underſtand what is ſaid more generally in any law, according to the limitation which the law it ſelf gives, eſpecially if it be in expreſs words.</p>
               <p>I admit this later and more reſtrained ſenſe of the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as probable; and in this diſquiſition I proceed accordingly, taking the declared aſſent and conſent as limited to the <hi>uſe</hi> of things. Nevertheleſs it muſt neceſſarily extend to the uſe of all things contained and preſcribed in the Liturgy. And thereupon I judg, that not only all the forms of ſacred adminiſtrations, but alſo all the Rubricks, together with the Calender and Tables, and every part thereof, comes within the compaſs of this declaration.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64714:74"/>
               <p>As concerning the import of the aſſent and conſent to be given thereunto, I take it unqueſtionably to ſignifie, according to the genuine ſenſe of the words, our approbation or allowance of the uſe of all things as aforeſaid, and not meerly to bind us for peace ſake not to oppoſe them. Wherefore if the uſe of any one thing great or ſmall therein comprehended, be not allowable, there is juſt ground of refuſing this declaration.</p>
               <p>Aſſent and conſent to the uſe of all things, ſuppoſeth that all are lawful; it ſuppoſeth alſo, that all things are ſo far fit to be uſed, as to have no ſuch evil conſequence as may juſtly forbid their uſe: it ſuppoſeth alſo, that the whole and every part of this book is ſo far true, as to have no errors which doth entrench upon the Chriſtian Faith, or hath bad influence on mens lives.</p>
               <p>I think I may comply for charity and peace ſake, in the uſe of indifferent things of no hurtful tendency, tho they be unuſeful or unprofitable; yet I query whether I may declare my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the uſe of thoſe unuſeful or unprofitable things, or to the uſing of them inſtead of things uſeful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
               <p>I think ſome little errors and untruths of inconſiderable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſuch as little miſ tranſlations or miſapplications of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phraſe, may be tolerated in the ſervice of God; yet I query whether I may declare ſuch aſſent and conſent to all and every thing, as doth expreſs a juſtifying of thoſe little errors and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, or an allowing of the retained uſe of them. My bare uſing of them, neceſſarily ſignifies no more than that I judg them to be tolerable; but my declaring conſent to the required uſe of them, ſignifies that I judg them to be allowable.</p>
               <p>I think I may joyn in a prayer, as it is ſound and good for the ſubſtance, tho it hath ſome little error doctrinal or hiſtorical cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in it; yet I query whether I may perſonally uſe or conſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the uſe of ſuch error.</p>
               <p>I query whether I may declare unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the uſe of things in themſelves indifferent, if I heartily wiſh they were not uſed in regard of inconveniences or offences ariſing from them.</p>
               <p>I query alſo, Whether I may declare my aſſent and conſent to the uſe of a Rubrick being an injunction, if I diſallow the injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thing preſcribed in it; and in conſenting to a rule or law as ſuch, I conſent not only to the doing of the thing preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64714:74"/>but to the preſcribing or enjoining thereof.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as I am not ſufficiently clear, whether the words <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned aſſent and conſent</hi> do import only an acknowledgment of the things as ſimply lawful and paſſable; or beſides this, an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof as laudable and deſirable; I do here in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars reſolve diverſly according to the different ſuppoſition of the higher or lower meaning of the ſaid words.</p>

For theſe words thereof, <hi>That the Book of Common-prayer, and of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, contains nothing contrary to the word of God;</hi> ſeem plainly comprehenſive as well of things aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, as of things to be done or uſed; and the truth of the one ſort ſeems to be acknowledged, as well as the uſe of the other ſort to be allowed. And to ſay, That nothing therein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God, ſeems to me as much as to ſay, that all things therein are agreeable to the word of God. The word of God is the Rule by which all things in the Liturgy ought to be regulated. Now for a thing that is under a Rule, to be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rule, is all one as to be agreeable thereunto. Any moral act not contrary to Gods Law, is agreeable to it; and what is not agreeable to it, is contrary to it.</p>

                  <p>I Do not think it in it ſelf unlawful, or utterly unfit, that ſome Apocryphal Chapters ſhould be read in the Church. But I queſtion whether I may conſent to the uſe of the Calendar and Tables ſo far as they direct to the reading of Apocryphal Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64714:75"/>in the ſame place, and under the ſame title with Canonical Chapters; alſo to the reading of the proper leſſons, tho apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal, rather than the leſſons in the ordinary courſe, tho canonical. I grant that the Church in her Articles of Religion, doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſtinguiſh between the Canonical and Apocryphal Books; nevertheleſs the aforeſaid uſe of the Apocryphal Chapters in the liturgy, without any diſtinction of the Canonical there given, may tempt the Vulgar to take them for Gods word. It is to be noted, that in the order of reading the leſſons, the title of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Old Teſtament, is given to the Apocrypha.</p>
                  <p>I am more concerned to know whether there be no ſufficient objection againſt the matter of any of the Apocryphal Chapters appointed to be read, which may prove them not fit to be uſed in Divine ſervice.</p>

                     <hi>Judith</hi> c. 9. approveth the fact of <hi>Simeon</hi> againſt the <hi>Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> as performed by divine aſſiſtance and approbation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the like aſſiſtance in her enterprize. Chap. 10. and C. 11. ſhe ſpeaks things untrue. In defence of the preſcribed uſe of theſe Chapters, it is ſaid, that theſe things are related hiſtorically, and not for imitation, as many things are in the Canonical Scripture: Such as were <hi>Elijah</hi>'s interceſſion againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and both his and <hi>Jonah</hi>'s paſſionate deſire of death. But this doth not ſatisfie; for thoſe unwarrantable paſſages which in Canonical Scripture are related hiſtorically, are ſufficiently ſignified to be unwarrantable, as in particular thoſe ſpeeches of <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> are plainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to be their weakneſſes. But the aforeſaid paſſages in <hi>Judith</hi> ſeem to be recorded in way of approbation, being deliberate in a ſolemn prayer for ſucceſs in an enterprize; and ſhe expreſly prays for ſucceſs in her deceit; and nothing of the diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe things is intimated in that ſtory. I ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reading hereof as a holy leſſon, doth not tend to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldning of men in ſuch undertakings; and at leaſt whether it hath not the appearance of evil, from which we ought to abſtain, by the Apoſtles precept?</p>

Tho this fift chapter be left out of the Calendar, yet in other chapters appointed to be read, this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64714:75"/>perſon who ſpeaks that which was untrue, is ſet forth for a holy Angel. And c. 7.3. both the Angel and <hi>Tobias</hi> are reported to ſay to <hi>Raguel,</hi> that which was falſe on the Angels part, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were of the ſons of <hi>Naphtalim,</hi> who were captives in <hi>Niniveh.</hi> Tho we read in Scripture that Angels were ſometimes taken to be men, and ſo called by them that took them to be ſuch; yet we do not read therein, that any Holy Angels affirmed that they were men, and ſuch particular men by name.</p>

I confeſs there be arguments for the lawfulneſs of ſuch inſtitution, which I cannot well anſwer; and there be other arguments againſt it, which alſo I cannot well anſwer; and this later ſort I crave leave to propound in this place.</p>
                  <p>The occaſions of theſe days and times were exiſtent in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times; and if God would have had theſe days appointed,

                  <p>If the inſtitution of theſe days and times were neceſſary, it is equally neceſſary in all ages and parts of the Catholick Church, and is the matter of an univerſal Law, and ſo belongs to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>If the Univerſal Lawgiver hath reſerved any thing to his own power, it can be no leſs than the making of ſuch Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as are univerſally and perpetually neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>To affirm ſuch inſtitution to be univerſally neceſſary, when God hath made no Law concerning it in Scripture, is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſufficiency of Scripture, as a Catholick Rule of divine faith and worſhip. For men to inſtitute Ordinances of Worſhip ſuppoſed to be univerſally and perpetually neceſſary to the Church, ſuppoſeth a defect in the divine, univerſal, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ordinances, to be made up by adding other Ordinances by way of ſupplement.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Commandment being one of the Decalogue, ſeems to be of ſo high a nature, that man may not preſume to make the like. The Table of all the Feaſts to be obſerved, begins, <hi>All Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in the year:</hi> ſo it calls the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which it ſeems to put upon the ſame level with feaſts of humane inſtitution. And there ſeems as great a ſacredneſs (if not greater) conferred upon ſome of the high feſtivals, as upon the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which is of divine appointment.</p>
                  <p>The Lords day doth ſufficiently anſwer the ends for which thoſe feſtivals that relate to our Saviour are appointed: for that being in memory of his Reſurrection, implies a memorial of all things done for mans redemption.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch Inſtitutions as theſe be not prohibited, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. I enquire of what ſort is the prohibited addition there ſpoken of? The prohibition ſeems to me to be not meerly of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule, to wit, the written law; but of doing more than that Rule required; as the precept is not of preſerving the Rule, but obſerving what is commanded in it. I do not queſtion the lawfulneſs of ſuch humane inſtitutions in divine Worſhip as are in meer ſubordination to divine inſtitution, and ſerve for the more convenient modifying and ordering thereof, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are not properly additions thereunto, becauſe they are not of the ſame nature and uſe, but are meerly accidentals of worſhip.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64714:76"/>But I doubt of ſuch humane Ordinances of divine worſhip as are coordinate with the divine Ordinances, and expreſs the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reaſon, end and uſe with them, and are additions properly ſo called. The feſtival days appointed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are in the Table of feaſts ſet in coordination with the Lords day; and they are not meerly the accidentals, but very important inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral parts of divine ſervice in this Church. In reaſon it muſt needs be that God hath ſufficiently provided for his honour, in the worſhip which he hath inſtituted, as much as belongs to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and end of thoſe things which he hath inſtituted. Thereupon I enquire, Whether it be not a preſuming of our own, againſt the divine wiſdom, to add to the divine Ordinances by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, humane ordinances of the ſame reaſon and intent with the divine?</p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion of the lawfulneſs of appointing ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, beſides the Lords day, either fixed or variable, to be ſpent in publick worſhip, wherein God is to be glorified for Jeſus Chriſt, and the work of redemption wrought by him. There is no queſtion of the lawfulneſs of appointing days of humiliation and thankſgiving, either for once, or anniverſarily upon ſpecial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and that beſides the ſpecial occaſions of thoſe days, things of univerſal and perpetual concernment ought to be minded in the religious exerciſes then performed. In theſe caſes the appointed days and times are only adjuncts of worſhip, which, as all other things, muſt be performed in ſome certain time; and they are for the worſhip, but the worſhip is not for them; and they are not intrinſecally holy, but only by extrinſick denomination from the holy worſhip then ſolemniz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d. But theſe conceſſions do not infer (as I ſuppoſe) the warrantableneſs of days appropriated to the ſame uſe and ends for which the Lords day is deſigned of God, and made intrinſecally and permanently holy, and ſanctifying the worſhip, as well as ſanctified by it, ſo that it were profaneneſs to alienate them to other uſes. Now as I aſſuredly believe that the <hi>Lords day</hi> is intrinſecally, and permanently, or unalterably holy, as well ſanctifying the duties therein performed, as ſanctified by them; ſo I ſuppoſe that the appointed feaſts, or at leaſt ſome of them, are ſet apart by the Church to a ſtate of like holineſs.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, that as touching the dedication of ſuch days and times as ſome of thoſe are which are appointed by the Church, I have not a clearneſs of judgment to determine for or againſt the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64714:77"/>warrantableneſs thereof. Nor would I break with the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, but would make thoſe days an occaſion of joining in the unqueſtionable divine worſhip then celebrated. But I know not how to declare an unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of thoſe days, becauſe in ſo doing I ſhould not ſpeak the truth, while I doubt of the warrantableneſs thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Of the Creed of St.</hi> Athanaſius.</head>
                  <p>I Heartily own the whole Doctrine of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of the Son of God, as ſet forth in this Creed; yet I am not ſatisfied to declare my aſſent to theſe aſſertions, <hi>Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he ſhall periſh everlaſtingly.</hi> Alſo, <hi>This is the Catholick faith, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved.</hi> Alſo, <hi>he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that will be ſaved, muſt thus think of the Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Creed doth contain deep myſteries, as that the Son is not made, nor created, but begotten; That the Holy Ghoſt is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between eternal generation, and eternal proceſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a myſtery wherein the greateſt Divines ſee but darkly, we may be juſtly afraid to condemn all perſons as uncapable of ſalvation, who do not underſtand and explicitely believe theſe myſteries.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> being here delivered as a part of the faith, concerning which it is aſſerted, That except every one do keep whole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he ſhall periſh everlaſtingly; the undoubted damnation of thoſe Churches and Chriſtians who hold that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father only, ſeems to be thence inferred.</p>
                  <p>The beſt anſwer to theſe objections that I have ſeen, I here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe out of a book lately written. It is to be conſidered, That in this Creed there be ſome things contained and expreſſed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points of Faith, and other things for the more clear and uſeful explication of the truth, tho they be not of equal neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be underſtood and believed even by the meaneſt capacity. Thus if we firſt conſider the contexture of this Creed, the Faith declared neceſſary concerning the Trinity, is thus expreſſed in the beginning thereof: <hi>The Catholick Faith is this, That we worſhip one God in Trinity and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, neither confounding the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor dividing the ſubſtance.</hi> After this follows an explication uſeful to ſet forth the true Chriſtian Doctrine, which begins: <hi>For there is one perſon of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. After which explication the ſame neceſſary doctrine to be known and believed, is thus again expreſſed and diſtinguiſhed from that explication, in theſe words: <hi>So that in all things as aforeſaid, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Trinity, and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, is to be worſhipped; he therefore who will be ſaved,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64714:78"/>muſt thus think of the Trinity.</hi> What is contained in this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is the more clear by the following obſervation, That our Church doth both here and in her Articles evidently receive the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed; and yet from the manner of uſing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed in the form of Baptiſm, as containing the profeſſion of that Faith into which we are baptized; in the Catechiſm, as containing all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; and in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of the ſick, as being the Rule to try whether he believe as a Chriſtian man ſhould, or not; it is manifeſt that no more is eſteemed in our Church of neceſſity to ſalvation for all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than that only which is contained and expreſſed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto I make this Reply;</p>
                  <p>In this point the queſtion is not, What the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but what the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed appointed by this Church to be read on certain ſolemn days, inſtead of the Apoſtles Creed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be of neceſſity to ſalvation. Now the thing that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly aſſerted in this Creed to be of neceſſity to ſalvation, is the intire belief of the Catholick Faith, as it is there expreſſed. For it is ſaid, <hi>Which Faith</hi> except <hi>every one keep whole,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore to diſtinguiſh the ſummary of the doctrine of the Trinity ſet down in the beginning and the concluſion, from the whole intermediate explication thereof, as if the belief of the one, but not of the other, were affirmed to be neceſſary to ſalvation, is a very forc'd and unwarrantable narrowing of the intendment of the Words. The explication, as well as the ſaid Summary, is ſet forth as that Catholick Faith, which except every one keep whole and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he ſhall without doubt periſh everlaſtingly. Yea, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid in the cloſe, <hi>So that in all things, as aforeſaid, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Trinity, and the Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, is to be worſhipped; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that will be ſaved, muſt thus think of the Trinity.</hi> What leſs than the whole doctrine aforegoing can the ſaid words, <hi>in all things as aforeſaid,</hi> refer to? For ought doth appear, no one part of the doctrine or explication is made more neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than another. Beſides, in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> in the doctrine of the Perſon of Chriſt, why may not the ſummary thereof expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe words, <hi>and in one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only begotten Son of God,</hi> be diſtinguiſhed in like manner from the following explicatory words, <hi>begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, light of light,</hi> &amp;c. as if the one, but not the other, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intended as neceſſary to be believed?</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64714:78"/>
                  <p>Moreover if the ſenſe of this Creed in the ſaid Aſſertions be not to exclude from ſalvation all ſuch as do not ſo diſtinctly know. nor ſo explicitely believe concerning the doctrine of the Trinity, as its ſets forth in the explication thereof; yet certainly it can be taken for no leſs than the excluding of ſuch as apprehend and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in any point contrary thereto, which is the caſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church in denying the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son.</p>
                  <p>Admit the ſaid Aſſertions are to be reſtrained to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, as is expreſſed only in the ſummary of the doctrine: I then make this query, Whether none of thoſe who being of very low capacities, do not diſtinctly apprehend and explicitely believe one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, ſo as in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions neither to confound the perſons, nor divide the ſubſtance, can truly and ſavingly fear God, and believe in Chriſt?</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Here let it be no offence to make the following Queries.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether it be certain by the word of God, that all thoſe of the Chriſtian profeſſion whoſe apprehenſions of the Trinity were not fully conformable to the Faith of the <hi>Homouſians</hi> (as the Orthodox were called in thoſe times) did periſh everlaſtingly? 2. Whether it be certain by the Word of God, that all thoſe who ſo apprehended of the union of the natures in Chriſt, as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt either by the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> or <hi>Eutychians,</hi> did periſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore I enquire, Whether it be certain by the Word of God, That all Pagans who have lived ſince the times of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to whom the Goſpel was never publiſhed, are damned? In the aforeſaid Aſſertions the form of words being unlimited and univerſal, ſeems to import ſo much. Now the caſe of ſuch who live in meer negative infidelity, being without the revelation of the Goſpel, is different from theirs who by wilful perverſeneſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Faith, againſt the evidence of that Divine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Holy Scripture, which they profeſs to believe. Without doubt none of the whole ſtock of Mankind can be ſaved, but through the Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt. But it is not ſo certain that all are damned who live and dye without the knowledg of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him. I certainly know, That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord; and that no man can be holy, without
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64714:79"/>the ſanctifying operation of the Holy Spirit. But that none of them are ſanctified who are without the knowledg of Chriſt and his Goſpel, is not ſo evidently and certainly known to me, either from Scripture or Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of the matter is, That I am afraid in the ſolemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of a Creed in the midſt of Divine Service, to adjudg thoſe to eternal damnation that are not ſo adjudged by the word of God; yet I heartily and entirely aſſent to the doctrine of the Trinity, and of the Incarnation of Chriſt, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof, as ſet forth in this Creed; and I would not give my ſuffrage that any ſhould be allowed in the publick Miniſtry, who holds in any point contrary to the ſaid doctrine.</p>

It is therefore queſtioned, whether the ſaid words may be ſtatedly uſed in a ſolemn prayer of the Church.

                  <head>Of the Order for the Miniſtration of the Holy Communion.</head>
                  <p>IT is liable to exception, That a great part of the Communion Service (as it is called) which makes a great part of the Morning-prayer for the Lords day, is appointed to be read at
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64714:79"/>the Communion-Table, when there is no adminiſtration of the Sacrament. If the declared conſent hereunto, import no more, than that, it may be complyed with in ſubmiſſion to authority, I ſhall not refuſe it.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth Commandment, it is appointed to be read, <hi>The Lord bleſſed the Seventh day,</hi> inſtead of <hi>the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath-day.</hi> It may well be queſtioned, whether one may conſent to the changing of God own Words, in this Commandment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other words of mans chuſing? But if the declared conſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not the changing of one word for another, but only the ſimple uſing of that word, which ſtands in the Liturgy; I ſhall not utterly refuſe it, ſeeing it hath nothing that is falſe or evil; nor any ſo conſiderable inconvenience, (that I diſcern), as to neceſſitate to a non-compliance. Yet I diſlike the retaining of it.</p>
                  <p>In the Exhortation, preparatory to the Sacrament, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That it is requiſite, that no man ſhould come to the Holy Communion, but with a full truſt in Gods Mercy, and quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Here it is ſaid not only, that it is a duty to be ſo qualified in coming, but that it is requiſite that no man ſhould come, but ſo qualified. This ſeems to mean, that the ſaid qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification is ſo neceſſary, that none may lawfully come without it. It is hereupon to be conſidered, whether a godly Chriſtian under doubts and fears touching his own eſtate towards God, and apprehenſive of Gods diſpleaſure towards him, may not have that Grace which may enable him to come acceptably to this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Tho I do not ſcruple the lawfulneſs of kneeling in the act of receiving the Sacramental Bread and Wine, yet it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Rule, that debars from the Lords Supper all Chriſtians who through unfeigned ſcruple of conſcience refuſe this geſture; eſpecially, conſidering that it was not uſed in the firſt Celebration by our Saviour with his Diſciples, nor in the Apoſtles time, as doth any way appear; nor afterwards, when General Councils forbad kneeling in any act of adoration on the <hi>Lords day.</hi> To this it may be anſwered, that it is not the enjoyning, but the uſing of this geſture, that is conſented to; and the objected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience follows not the uſing, but the enjoyning thereof in the rigor, as to debar from the Sacrament thoſe that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it. But I further inquire: Whether a conſent to the uſe of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64714:80"/>a Rubrick, which hath the nature of an injunction, doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a conſent not only to the uſing, but to the injoyning of the thing therein preſcribed? Moreover the very uſing or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of this Rubrick by the Miniſter, is an injunction in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the people; becauſe it includes an obligation upon him not to deliver the Sacrament to them, except they uſe this geſture.</p>
                  <p>In the Rubrick after the Communion, <hi>Note that every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioner ſhall communicate, at the leaſt three times in the year, whereof</hi> Eaſter <hi>to be one.</hi> That it is the duty of every Pariſhioner to be fit to receive the Sacrament, and accordingly to receive it; alſo that the Church may require this duty of all her Members, and Cenſure thoſe who continue wilfully unfit, is not to be queſtioned. But this Rubrick injoyns all Pariſhioners to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and the Pariſh-Miniſters to admit them, without any proviſo here made touching their fitneſs, or due caution elſewhere taken for it, that I know of; when it is ſadly known, that in moſt Pariſhes, too many Pariſhioners are notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And we ſee the practice conſequent to this Rule, a conſtant general admiſſion or intruſion of notoriouſly ignorant or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Perſons, who pollute the Communion of the Church, and eat and drink Damnation to themſelves. Beſides this, Infidels, Papiſts, and ſuch as ſecretly at leaſt renounce the Communion of the Pariſh-Churches, are Pariſhioners in many places. Now tho ſuch may be compelled to uſe thoſe means which God hath made univerſally neceſſary to bring the ignorant and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous to the knowledg of the truth; yet I do not ſee, that they may be injoyned in word or deed to profeſs what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, or to take that which is the ſpecial Priviledg of Viſible Church-Members.</p>

Here is an outward Viſible ſign of an inward ſpiritual Grace. The outward ſign, is the repreſentation of the Croſs, the inſtrument of Chriſts Suffering; the ſpiritual Grace, is the Grace of being a Chriſtian, or a Soldier and Servant of Chriſt, and of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fortitude conſequent thereunto, as the Words of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy do import: <hi>And we ſign him with the ſign of the Croſs, in token, hereafter he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, and to fight manfully under his banner againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil, and to continue Chriſts faithful Soldier and Servant unto his lives end.</hi>

For in the Liturgy it is declared to be a token of our engagement to Chriſt crucified in the relations of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and Servant, and to perform the duties of thoſe relations. Moreover, as Baptiſm dedicates to Chriſt, ſo doth the ſign of the Croſs, according to the expreſs words of the <hi>Canon,</hi> viz. <hi>It is an honourable badge, whereby the party baptized is dedicated to the Service of him that dyed upon the Croſs.</hi>

                  <p>Hereupon I inquire, Whether an Ordinance that is of the ſame import with the Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace, or an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part thereof, may be inſtituted by humane authority, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed by thoſe that are under authority? Tho the Impoſers ſay, it is not a Sacrament, yet while they declare its meaning to be of the formal Nature of a Sacrament, they make it to be one indeed, tho in word they deny it. Whereas to avoid this Argument, ſome ſay, it is impoſible for man to make a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore the ſign of the Croſs cannot be ſuch: it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That tho God only can inſtitute a lawful and valid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his Covenant; yet man may preſume to inſtitute an Ordinance of the ſame nature, and reaſon, and intent, with a Sacrament of divine inſtitution, tho it be unlawful, and of no effect. And ſuch an Ordinance is truly and properly a Sacrament, tho an unlawful one, as any other Ordinance deviſed by man, that hath the Nature and formal Reaſon of Religious Worſhip, is truly and properly Worſhip, whatſoever may be ſaid of the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs thereof.</p>

                     <hi>The Reply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The grand objection againſt the lawfulneſs of the ſign of the Croſs, as uſed in Baptiſm, ſuppoſes that it is of the ſame Nature with a Sacrament of the Covenant of Grace, whereupon the proper Nature of ſuch a Sacrament is neceſſary to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Sacraments are ſigns appointed to ratiſie, ſeal, and confirm the Covenant of God, and to tender and exhibit the Grace of that Covenant to us. And if any humane authority conſtitute any ſign to this end, it would be a high intrenchment upon the ſoveraignty of God. But the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, is not uſed to this end and purpoſe. It is uſed indeed as a token by way of remembrance, and as a teſtimony of engagement, that the party baptized ſtands obliged to maintain the Chriſtian profeſſion and warfare. And altho ſuch profeſſion and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be included in a Sacrament; yet it is not peculiar thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or of its ſpecifically differencing nature. Standing at the Creed, is a profeſſing and engaging ſign of Chriſtianity, yet it is not a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>It appears both by the 30th Canon, and by the Liturgy it ſelf, That the Infant baptized, is by vertue of Baptiſm, before it be ſigned with the ſign of the Croſs, received into the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Flock, as a perfect member thereof, and not by any power aſcribed to the ſign of the Croſs. And tho it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Canon, That it is an honourable badge, whereby the party Baptized is dedicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this Dedication by the Croſs, is wholly diſtinct from the baptiſmal Dedication, to be a Member of the Church. We muſt underſtand, that the Church by this ſign engageth the party upon her account to the Service of Chriſt. The Miniſter acting in the Name of God, baptizeth the party in the name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but acting in the name of the Church, he ſigneth him with the ſign of the Croſs. This ſign is not any tender of Grace received from God, nor any proper conſecration to God, in his Name and Authority, and as by his Symbol; but a declarative token of duty and engagement to God. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were circumciſed, kept the Paſſover, and had their Sacrifices, all which were tokens of the Covenant between God and them: Yet <hi>Joſhua</hi> did ſolemnly engage them to God, by ſetting up a Stone as a Witneſs thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:64714:81"/>
                  <p>The Objection and Reply, I leave for a while to further conſideration. I have ſomewhat more to ſay touching this point.</p>
                  <p>The Stone of Witneſs ſet up by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> was a meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing or witneſſing-ſign of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> acknowledged Relation and Obligation to God; and the erecting or uſing of it, was not for their Dedication to God, as by an Act of ſolemn Worſhip. The uſing of the Croſs in Banners and Coyns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no Act of Religious Worſhip; but a profeſſing-ſign, or ſignal Action, to teſtifie to the World, that they who uſe it, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt crucified. And ſurely, it is not unlawful to profeſs by other ſigns, as well as by words, that we are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p>But the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, is a ſolemn and ſtated Symbol of a Divine Myſtery: Its uſage therein, is not a meer circumſtance, but a very important Act of Divine Worſhip. It is a compleat Inſtitution of it ſelf, added to the Ordinance of Chriſt, appearing to be of the ſame nature and end. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently uſed as a rite of ſolemn Dedication to God, upon the terms of the Covenant of Grace; and in this regard it is plainly Sacramental, and it ſeems a Dedication added by way of ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Baptiſmal Dedication, and in that regard derogatory from the ſufficiency of Baptiſm to that end. It is alſo perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Miniſter of Chriſt, acting as his Miniſter towards one of his Flock. Moreover, it is a rite, not of private arbitrary uſe, but of publick inſtitution; and it is made a matter, not of occaſional temporary Obſervance, but a perpetual Ordinance of Worſhip, of the ſame reaſon with thoſe Ordinances which God hath inſtituted to be univerſally and perpetually obſerved by his Church. Sacred rites of this nature, more than thoſe which God hath inſtituted, are not of that rank of things which are neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and need to be determined <hi>in ſpecie;</hi> and being not neceſſary, they may be matter of ſcruple to thoſe, who think that unneceſſary rites of Worſhip ſhould not be ordained, or ſtatedly uſed in conjunction with the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>That God hath reſerved ſome things in Religion to his own appointment, and left other things therein to humane Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, is not to be queſtioned. But to diſcern exactly and throughly between the one and the other ſort, I want a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64714:82"/>clearneſs of Judgment. That the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, as now uſed, is to me a puzling difficulty, I am not aſhamed to confeſs, tho it may be thought a weakneſs in me.</p>
                  <p>If the ſign of the Croſs were lawful, I am not ſatisfied to declare an aſſent and conſent to the impoſing of it, as a bar againſt the Baptiſm of the Children of thoſe Parents who judg it unlawful, and a ſin in them to permit the ſigning of their Children there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. To this it may be anſwered, That it is not the injoyning, but the uſing of this ceremony, that is conſented to. But here alſo I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether I may lawfully declare an unfeigned conſent to the uſe of this Rubrick, if I diſſent from the injunction of the things thereby injoyned? The uſe of this Rubrick doth include ſuch an Obligation upon the Miniſter, as hinders his Baptizing of the Children of ſuch Parents as are before deſcribed. Further I inquire, Whether I may declare my unfeigned conſent to the uſe of this ceremony, if I be perſwaded, that it is not in it ſelf unlawful, yet wiſh in my heart, that the uſe thereof were not retained, in regard it is neceſſary, and an occaſion of ſtumbling to many? I may ſubmit to the uſe of a thing, not ſimply evil, when I may not declare a hearty conſent to it.</p>
                  <p>The ſaving Regeneration of all baptized Infants, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Salvation if they dye before actual ſin, being aſſerted in the Liturgy, is to be conſidered. In the prayer after the Child is Bapt zed, are theſe words, <hi>We yield thee hearty thanks, moſt merciful Father, that it hath pleaſed thee to regenerate this Infant with thy Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. At the end of publick Baptiſm, there is this Rubrick, <hi>It is certain by Gods word, that Children which are baptized, dying before actual ſin, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved.</hi> Admitting that the injoyned Declaration doth not reſpect this Rubrick, as being not a matter of practice, but a doctrinal aſſertion: Nevertheleſs the form of thankſgiving for all baptized Children aforcited, is unqueſtionably contained under it, and I am ingaged to examine the truth and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>The extent of the efficacy of Baptiſm is a point much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Proteſtant Divines among themſelves, and the ſtate of Infants ſeems not to be ſo fully and clearly expreſs'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the ſtate of adult perſons; and I acknowledg my ſelf unable to dertermine thereof in the manner here required.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64714:82"/>The Queſtion is not, Whether there be any ſaving-benefit to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by Baptiſm? But, whether every Infant admitted thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, be regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and received of God for his own Child by Adoption? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That an Infant be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of theſe ſaving-benefits, beſides his being baptized, this condition is requiſite, that he be duly qualified for Baptiſm, and have right thereunto in the ſight of God. Be it granted that the Sacrament hath its effect, where the receiver doth not ſet a bar againſt it; yet it muſt be ſuppoſed, that the receiver is one who hath right to Baptiſm in the fight of God, and to whom the promiſe of Salvation doth belong. But I do not find that the promiſe of Salvation belongs to Children, whoſe Parents, Proparents, or proprietors, are impious, or infidels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mask of the Chriſtian profeſſion; or that ſuch have right before God to Baptiſm, whatſoever right they may have before the Church, while the impiety or infidelity of the Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not diſcovered. It is not enough to ſay, that the Infants title to Baptiſm is founded in Chriſt Inſtitution of the Sacrament. For as there muſt be an Inſtitution of the Sacrament, ſo there muſt be a due qualification of the ſubject that receives it. The Infants of <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Mahomitans,</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> do not actually ſet a bar againſt the efficacy of the Sacrament; yet it cannot be ſaid of ſuch Infants, in caſe they were baptized, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the Holy Spirit. The Parents infidelity doth put a bar to the efficacy of the Sacrament towards his Infant; and this bar is not properly a puniſhment to the Infant, but meerly a non-deliverance, or a being left in the ſtate of ſin and wrath, wherein he is by nature.</p>
                  <p>I ſtill query, Whether the aforecited aſſertion, That <hi>it is certain by Gods word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved;</hi> be not contained under the Declaration? It being the matter of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Rubrick, and for uſe, as I ſuppoſe. Moreover this Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick ſeems evidently included in the injoyned Subſcription, and to be juſtified thereby, as not contrary to the word of God. Now the ſame things that are objected about the ſaving Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all baptized Children, may be objected in reference to this alſo. Beſides, to affirm the certainty of this poſition by the word of God, is much harder than to admit it as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable truth only. Whereas it is ſaid, that this poſition may be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64714:83"/>acknowledged as certainly true of children indefinitely, without denying it to be true univerſally. I anſwer, That to underſtand it but of children indefinitely, is to make it an inſignificant and uſeleſs Aſſertion, unworthy to be matter of a Rubrick, as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more, but that it is certainly true, that all baptized chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not damaned, but ſome ſaved. This is not rationally appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be the meaning thereof.</p>
                  <p>According to the order preſcribed in the Liturgy, Children are devoted to God, and brought into the Covenant of Grace, and the Baptiſmal Vow by Godfathe s and Godmothers, who have no propriety in them, nor right of dedicating them to God, or bringing them into his Covenant; and the Parents who have right, and by whom the Infants have title to this priviledg, are excluded. It is not mans Law that can authorize any to bring children into the bond of the Covenant with God. And there is no Law of God that authorizeth any beſides Parents, Proparents, or Proprietors, ſo to do. Tho the taking in of Sureties in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Parents for a greater aſſurance of the Infants Chriſtian Education, may be commendable and uſeful, if thoſe Sureties did indeed concern themſelves therein, and not make it a matter of meer formality, (as generally it is made) yet there can be no reaſon for ſuch a rigid inſiſting upon Sureties, the uſe of whom at the moſt is but expedient for greater caution about the Childs future education, and in the mean time to overlook, yea to exclude the Parents open and ſolemn dedication of the infant, which is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>That form of ſpeaking to the Infant by the Sureties, <hi>Doſt thou renounce,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doſt thou believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wilt thou be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wilt thou obediently keep,</hi> &amp;c. and the taking of ſeveral anſwers as from him by the Sureties, is not a form of words expreſſing ones being devoted or brought into Gods Covenant by another, but of ones own profeſſed preſent actual believing, deſiring, and vowing. If it be ſaid, This is ſpoken to the Sureties in the Childs name, and 'tis a declaring of what the child undertakes by his baptiſm. I anſwer, The child is not capable of doing any thing in the caſe, and the child doth not, and cannot undertake any thing by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as in his name. To ſay the Infant doth theſe things paſſively, and that he doth paſſively accept the Covenant, is that which I do not underſtand. I grant that baptized infants are under a vow of dedication to God, but not a vow made by themſelves, but by
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64714:83"/>thoſe whom God hath authorized to dedicate them, and by which they are bound, as much as by a vow actually made by themſelves when they are capable.</p>

The Query is, Whether
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64714:84"/>I may conſent to the uſe of a Rule inſufficient for its end?</p>
                  <p>Confirmation is reſerved to the Biſhop alone; yet it is ordinarily impoſſible for him to take due notice of all perſons to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within his Dioceſs; and conſequently it cannot be duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to a multitude of perſons that are to be brought to it. Whereas it is alledged, That this reſervation was the uſage of the ancient Church; let it be conſidered, that the primitive or more ancient biſhops were biſhops but of one particular Church, and were capable of taking the overſight of every particular perſon of their flock, and did perſonally perform the ſame. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent biſhops being biſhops of many hundred Churches, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more ſouls in their ſeveral Dioceſſes, than an hundred bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops can perſonally watch over.</p>
                  <p>In the prayer immediately before the act of Confirmation, it is ſaid of all perſons admitted to it, That God hath vouchſafed to regenerate them by water and the Holy Ghoſt, and hath given them the forgiveneſs of all their ſins. I enquire, Whether this be warrantable, and according to truth, conſidering what is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of human nature, and what the inclinations and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of moſt young ones are, and what regeneration by the Holy Ghoſt doth import; and how ſuch as are far from any credible appearance of Regeneration, may be qualified for Confirmation, according to the terms preſcribed in this book; and beſides all this, that children of ungodly Parents, to whom the promiſe of ſalvation doth not belong, cannot be ſuppoſed to be really regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and pardoned by Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Let the tendency of the ſaid aſſertion, as alſo of that touching the ſaving regeneration, and undoubted ſalvation of all baptized infants, be well conſidered, whether it be to bring men to a ſight of their miſery in the unregenerate ſtate, and an endeavour of their recovery by real regeneration, or to keep them from it.</p>

It is granted, That a credible, approved
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64714:84"/>profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, may be made neceſſary to admiſſion; becauſe they, who do not make ſuch profeſſion, are juſtly excluded from Communion in the Sacrament. But there are many that are fit for this Communion, that are not willing to ſubmit to this order of Confirmation. And if their refuſal of it be culpable, yet it may not deſerve ſo great puniſhment, as excluſion from the Sacrament.</p>

But every ſimilitude uſed in Scripture to expreſs a holy Myſtery, (as that of the Vine and the Branches, to expreſs the Union betwixt Chriſt and the faithful), is not conſecrated to a repreſentation thereof.

                  <p>It may be conſidered, whether this manner of giving Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adminiſtring the Sacrament to every Sick perſon that is deſirous to receive the ſame, tend to bring men to repentance, or to harden them in impenitency.</p>

But multitudes, that are not here accepted, dye in notorious ſin, and give no credible evidence of their repentance.</p>
                  <p>Tho we be not infallibly certain, that ſuch notorious ſinners, and in all appearance impenitent to the laſt, are damned; yet it may be queſtioned, whether there be ground of hope for their being ſaved, and whether they may be owned as Brethren that reſt in Chriſt, and whom God of his great mercy hath taken to himſelf, and on whoſe behalf we ought to give thanks to God, that he hath taken them out of the miſeries of this life. It may alſo be queſtioned, Whether it be of ſafe or dangerous tendency for the Church in her publick Leturgy,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64714:86"/>ſolemnly to declare all this at their interment.</p>
                  <p>Tho the words <hi>in ſure and certain hope of the Reſurrection to eternal Life,</hi> be to be underſtood of the Reſurrection in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not of the Reſurrection of the deceaſed party; yet the very committing of his Body to the ground, in ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hope of the Reſurrection to eternal Life in general, doth imply ſome degree of grounded hope of his part in that Reſurrection, or elſe the ſaid words ſeem to be uſed imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is ſaid, There is ſome degree of Hope, where we cannot determine the contrary: I anſwer, that this which is called a degree of Hope, is a meer negative, or nothing, and ſignifies no more, than that we are not infallibly ſure of mens final Impenitence and Damnation. This is not properly any degree of Hope, nor doth it include any Judgment made of the party, it being a meer negative. And here no Judgment of Charity is included, becauſe here is no ground thereof ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  <p>It doth not ſatisfie to ſay, That the Church ſuppoſeth all who dye in her Communion to be hopeful; becauſe this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and requireth the due exerciſe of diſcipline in the Church. Now we ſee that diſcipline is not ſo exerciſed, but that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, in whom no credible or hopeful evidence of repentance doth appear, dye in her Communion. And this omiſſion of diſcipline is conſtant, general, and uncontrolled.</p>
                  <p>It is granted, that dying-impenitents do not go immediately into the power of the Devil, but firſt into the hands of the great God, to be diſpoſed of by him according to the conditions of the Goſpel-Covenant, which flow from a grant of mercy. Nevertheleſs, we know that the Law of Grace and Mercy finally abuſed and violated, doth contain a Denunciation of the greateſt Wrath and Vengeance. And it ſeems very improper to ſay of one whom God hath taken into his own hands to adjudg to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting puniſhment for the final violation and contempt of the Covenant of Grace, That God hath taken him to his mercy, or unto himſelf of his great Mercy; becauſe he judgeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth him for violating the Law of Mercy. Beſides, what mortal man certainly knows whether the Judgment and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution immediately after Death, be not the ſame thing.</p>

                  <head>Some geneneral Obſervations upon the Book of Common-Prayer.</head>
                  <p>ACcording to the Tenor of this Book, every perſon in the external Communion of the Church, is ſet forth as godly or regenerate, when multitudes in the ſaid Communion are palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unregenerate and ungodly. This appears by ſeveral impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant paſſages already noted, touching every perſon baptized, confirmed, interred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by theſe further Inſtances. In the order of Matrimony, for every Married couple, this form is to be ſaid, <hi>O Lord ſave thy Servant, and thy Handmaid, who put their truſt in thee;</hi> and the like for every Sick perſon that is viſited by the Prieſt, and for every Woman that is Churched. It is likewiſe recommended as convenient, that the new married Perſons ſhould receive the Holy Communion at the time of their Marriage, or at the firſt opportunity after their Marriage, which ſeems to ſuppoſe, that all perſons who may lawfully be married, are fit to receive the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood.</p>
                  <p>The Objection here made, is not againſt the applying of the aforeſaid, or the like form of words, or the vouchſafing of the aforeſaid Priviledge of the Holy Sacrament to thoſe that give any credible evidence of their faith and repentance; but that it is done to all indifferently, whatſoever their ſtate towards God appears to be. Indeed the Church may be called Holy, as the Apoſtles writing to the Churches, give them the ſtile of Saints, and thoſe that are ſanctified, and holy Brethren, and the like. But the query is, Wherther they would, or we may account every Pariſhioner, who is not excommunicate in this preſent way of Church-Government, to be penitent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and holy; and wether we may uſe towards every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pariſhioner, ſuch forms of words as import their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned faith, notwithſtanding a manifeſt appearance of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and ungodlineſs?</p>
                  <p>If the omiſſion of things moſt neceſſary in ſome main parts of the Liturgy, be a juſt ground of not declaring an unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the forms as there preſcribed: I may urge, that in the general Confeſſion there is no mention of Original ſin. As for thoſe words, <hi>the devices and deſires of our own hearts,</hi> they denote actual ſins of the heart. And that clauſe, <hi>There
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64714:87"/>is no health in us,</hi> betokens there is no Salvation or Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in our ſelves. Or if it were deſigned in this place to fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify Original ſin, it is a very obſcure expreſſion thereof. This Omiſſion is the more liable to exception, if it be upon theſe Principles and Suppoſitions, that all who are in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion of the Church, are regenerate; that all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſons, yea or all baptized in Infancy, whether they be the Children of the promiſe or not, are delivered from the guilt of Original ſin: Or that no reliques of Original ſin, which are truly and properly ſin, remain in the regenerate.</p>
                  <p>It may be likewiſe urged, that in the ſaid Confeſſion there is no ſufficient expreſſing of actual ſins in particular; and that the Morning and Evening-prayer moſtly conſiſts of meer generals, without ſuch particular Confeſſion of ſins, and Petition for ſpiritual Graces, as is requiſite to be made on the behalf of the whole Congregation. There may be indeed particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Petitions proper for particular Perſons, which are not here intended: But there are others of common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and neceſſity to all Chriſtians. And my query is, Whether this ſort may be ſtatedly omitted in a publick Liturgy?</p>

                  <head>Of the form of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</head>
                  <p>IN the Preface it is ſaid, <hi>That it is evident to all men diligently reading the holy Scriptures and ancient Authors, That from the Apoſtles time there have been theſe Orders of Miniſters in Chriſts Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</hi> Between the Orders of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and deacons, there is unqueſtionably an eſſential difference. But if by the orders of biſhops and prieſts, be meant ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Offices ſpecifically or eſſentially different, and not ſeveral degrees of ſuperiority and inferiority in the ſame office, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential nature whereof is in both, I cannot by ſubſcription de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the ſaid aſſertion is not contrary to the word of God. Upon diligent reading of the Holy Scripture, I cannot find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the office or order of a presbyter that is no biſhop.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I conſent to this paſſage in the ſaid Preface, <hi>No man ſhall be accounted or taken for a lawful Prieſt, or be ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the function, except he be called according to this form, or hath had formerly Epiſcopal Ordination.</hi> I am no way ſatisfied in the diſabling or degrading of ſo many Miniſters as are ordained only by Presbyters.</p>

                  <p>THE laſt words <hi>[and none other]</hi> taken in their moſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſenſe, ſeem to exclude all other form of prayer uſed by the Miniſter before or after Sermon, whether conceived at the preſent, or precompoſed. For prayer before and after Sermon is publick prayer. Now it is expreſly promiſed by the Subſcriber, that he will uſe no other form in publick prayer, than what is preſcribed in the ſaid book. I know many Conformiſts do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe otherwiſe than is here expreſſed. But I know alſo, that ſome do urge this and another Canon againſt their practiſe; and I now enquire into the plain force of the words, which ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by a conſiderate Subſcriber.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it will be granted by all, That the Church intends hereby to engage againſt uſing any other form whatſoever in the adminiſtration of Sacraments; and thereupon one would think, that ſhe intended hereby to engage alſo againſt uſing any other form whatſoever in publick prayer, ſeeing in the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the engagement againſt the uſe of any other form, both in publick prayer, and adminiſtration of Sacraments, is alike expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>If any ſufficient reaſon or good warrant can be produced for reſtraining the words to the excluding only of the uſe of any other publick Liturgy, as for example the Maſs-book, or of any other publick Directory of Worſhip, inſtead of the Common-prayer; nevertheleſs it were to be wiſhed, that men might not be enjoined to make a promiſe in thoſe words, which in their plain ſenſe do expreſs an engagement which is not thereby intended.</p>
                  <p>I have conſidered many particulars which come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Declaration of unfeigned aſſent and conſent injoined by the Act of Uniformity, and the Subſcription required by the Thirty ſixth Canon. In all which my deſire and deſign is not to diſaffect any perſons to the Book of Common prayer, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction, if it may be had, concerning the things wherein I am diſſatisfied. For I own the ſaid form of worſhip to be in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64714:88"/>main ſound and good for the matter of it, and I ſincerely join with the Congregation in the ſame, tho I take it to be leſs perfect than is to be deſired. It is not therefore the uſe of a Liturgy in the publick Worſhip of God, nor the reading of the Common-prayer in the ordinary daily ſervice, that makes me a Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. But the high ſtrain of the Declaration and Subſcription, and the ſtrict obſervation of all things preſcribed, are difficulties which I cannot overcome.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration of the preſent ſtate of Conformity, hath proceeded according to the limited ſenſe of the Declaration, as reſtrained to the uſe of things, which being a probable limitation, I have willingly admitted for peace ſake. But there be thoſe who will not allow it, ſaying, that the true intendment of the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is to be taken from the plain ſignification of the form of words wherein it is expreſſed, which is no leſs than a full juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things whatſoever contained and preſcribed in and by the Book of Common-prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as right and good.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I am not able with a judgment of certainty to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which of theſe two explications doth truly and rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the full intendment of this Declaration. And tho I have admitted the more reſtrained meaning thereof as probable, yet the truth is I have not found that it doth any great matter to make the way of Conformity eaſie or paſſable, as appears by the foregoing examination of many things contained and preſcribed in the Liturgy. But if the other opinion of the more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive meaning, be true, the way is yet more difficult; for then the Declaration doth imply an acknowledgment of the truth of all aſſertions any where contained in this Book; alſo of the truth, lawfulneſs, and goodneſs of all expreſſions, not only in the divine Service it ſelf, but in all the directing-Rules, <hi>viz.</hi> Rubricks, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, and Tables; alſo of the lawfulneſs and fitneſs not only of the uſe of things injoined, but of the very injunction or impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſaid directing Rules being ſo many injunctions ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring us to obſerve the things preſcribed in them. But (as I have before obſerved) if the ſenſe of the Declaration be reſtrained to the uſe of things, it doth not appear that the injoined Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be ſo reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>As I have ſaid, I conſent to the uſe of the Common-prayer as a tolerable Form of Worſhip; but that doth not imply my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of all and every thing therein contained. Upon the review
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64714:88"/>of the whole matter, let it be impartially conſidered, whether a Declaration of ſo high a ſtrain, about a book of meer humane and fallible compoſition, containing in it many hundreds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and conſequences, ſhould be ſo rigorouſly exacted. If ſome recognition in this kind be thought neceſſary, it were to be deſired, that it might be contrived in a form of words leſs p r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing and enſnaring, yet ſufficiently engaging.</p>

                  <head>Of the Renouncing of the Obligation of the COVENANT, Required by the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</head>
                  <p>THis Covenant was not meerly a League between men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an Oath; but a Vow to God of ſeveral things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reſpecting him. And tho its intent were to engage men one to another, yet that was not the whole nor chief intent thereof: but its chief intendment was to engage all the Covenanters jointly to God.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever it be called an Oath, yet ſo far as it is an Oath of things which directly and immediately reſpect God, or that are to be performed towards him, it hath the nature of a Vow.</p>
                  <p>To invalidate the Obligation of an Oath or Vow made to God, is a thing of a high nature, and had need to be done with a clear judgment.</p>
                  <p>One point of this Oath or Vow, was to endeavour Church-Reformation according to our Places and Callings. And no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation can be without ſome Alteration.</p>
                  <p>Here the queſtion that concerns me, is, Whether there lies no ſecondary obligation from this Covenant, upon any perſon that took it, to do that which he was antecedently obliged to do, <hi>viz.</hi> To endeavour in his own place and calling, and only by legal ways, that alteration of Government in the Church, which is juſt and neceſſary to be made?</p>
                  <p>It is to be conſidered, that the Renunciation required, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare not only that there lies no obligation from the Covenant to endeavour an alteration of the ſubſtance of Church-government, to wit, Epiſcopacy; but that there lies no obligation thence to endeavour any alteration of Government in the Church. The extent of the words doth equally reſpect any change in any point, tho never ſo juſt and neceſſary.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:64714:89"/>
                  <p>It is a point too high for me to judg of all perſons whatſoever who have taken this Covenant, how far they are or are not bound thereby. And put caſe I may not be ſo clear and ſure in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to aſſert the obligation thereof, I may alſo not be ſo clear and ſure therein, as to renounce the obligation thereof.</p>
                  <p>As Gods Moral Law primarily obligeth to endeavour Church-Reformation, while there is corruption in the Church; ſo a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Swearing or Vowing thereof, infers a ſecondary or further obligation thereunto, in reſpect of the Oath or Vow.</p>
                  <p>God being a Party in an Oath or Vow of duties directly reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and antecedently required by his Law, no humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can nullifie the obligation thereof.</p>
                  <p>The unlawfulneſs of the impoſition, and the defect of Authority in the impoſers, or that it was taken conſtrainedly, or in ſinful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, doth not nullifie the obligation of an Oath or Vow, when the matter thereof is in it ſelf a duty.</p>
                  <p>The conjunction of things unlawful in an Oath or Vow, doth not make it null as to thoſe things which are antecedently neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. This Covenant conſiſts of many parts, which are indeed for the matter ſo many ſeveral Vows. And thoſe parts which are of things lawful and neceſſary, do not riſe from, nor depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe parts that are objected to be unlawful, but ſtand intire by their own force and valour. Now the queſtion is, Whether thoſe parts, which are of things lawful and neceſſary, can be made void by the conjuction of thoſe other parts objected to be unlawful?</p>
                  <p>The obligation of this Covenant cannot ceaſe by the mutual conſent of the Covenanters; becauſe it was not ſolely or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a league between men, but chiefly an Oath or Vow to God of things to be performed towards him; and the Union and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of men therein, was in vowing to God, who was the party chiefly intended in it.</p>
                  <p>Tho a Vow of things in themſelves arbitrary, being made by ſuch as are under the power of another, may be diſannulled by him under whoſe power they are; yet it is not ſo in Vows of thoſe things that are duties antecedently.</p>
                  <p>To be obliged by this Covenant to endeavour alteration of Government in the Church, ſo far as that alteration is juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be made, is againſt no due of obedience to Governours, no juſt rights of Superiors, or any perſons whatſoever.</p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:64714:89"/>
                  <p>This Covenant cannot oblige to any ſuch endeavour of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as includes the determining of matters of publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt the Law and mind of the Soveraign. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an endeavour of a juſt and neceſſary alteration by lawful ways and means, which is here taken into conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Several things of moment in the Eccleſiaſtical Government may need Reformation, tho Epiſcopacy remain as it was received in the ancient Church.</p>
                  <p>It is an ordinary and neceſſary practice to make an alteration of Laws, and ſo of Government, both in Civil and Eccleſiaſtical matters, from time to time, ſo far as need requires.</p>
                  <p>I freely declare, That there lies no obligation from this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon any perſon to endeavour any alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Church or State by Rebellion, Sedition, or any other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means.</p>
                  <p>There lies no obligation from this Covenant upon any perſon to endeavour by any means, any ſuch alteration of Government in Church or State, as may not lawfully be made by the authority of King and Parliament, nor be endeavoured by others in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the ſaid Authority.</p>
                  <p>I conſent to the Epiſcopacy that was of ancient Eccleſiaſtical cuſtom, as in the times of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>Cyprian.</hi>

                  <p>I am willing to exerciſe the Miniſtry under the preſent Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government, and to promiſe obedience to the Ordinary in things lawful and honeſt, if there were a relaxation about ſome injunctions, which I ſcruple; or if the grounds of my ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about them were removed.</p>
                  <p>I am ready to engage, not to diſturb the peace of the Church, and not to endeavour any point of alteration in its Government, by Rebellious, Seditious, or any unlawful ways.</p>
                  <p>I am ready to engage alſo, That I will not any way endeavour any point of alteration to be made in the Government of the Church, otherwiſe than by authority of King, of Parliament.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>TO make diligent ſearch into the nature of Divine Worſhip, I have judg'd my ſelf concern'd, as a Chriſtian, and a Miniſter, and a Sufferer for conſcientious diſſents and doubtings about ſome points thereof in joyned by Authority. Some Delineation of what I diſcern in this important matter, by the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace in reading and thinking, I have here drawn in a narrow compaſs. And I have done it to the intent, that I might have a Scheme of my thoughts herein, at hand, and ready for view, to be rectified where it is wrong, and to be further improved where it is right, and more readily managed as cauſe requires; likewiſe, that from others, who will do me the favour to peruſe and conſider it, I may have help for a better or clearer knowledg of theſe points. For I know my great defectiveneſs in this knowledg, and am an humble ſeeker of more clearneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs therein; yet I am not dubious in the main heads. In the body of an Animal, the greater veins are more eaſily diſcernable in their whole Syſteme; the ſma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

So in</hi> Theology, <hi>the large veins of the greateſt and moſt important truths, are very viſible and palpable; but the ſmaller branches thereof may not be eaſily diſcern'd, and are not traced in their ſeveral paſſages, without attentive and acurate inveſtigation. It behoves every one to do his beſt, for as perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in matters of his own Function and Practice, as he can reach unto. But when we have done all, we know but in part,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64714:91"/>and ſee darkly as in a glaſs: The ſenſe whereof ſhould diſpoſe men of different judgments to that conſiderateneſs and ſobriety, which will cauſe, that the one neither deſpiſe nor judg the other, but that all receive one another with mutual charity.</hi>

                  <head>§ 1. <hi>Of Worſhip in General.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS touching Worſhip in general, its Nature is by ſome ſet forth, to be an obſervance yielded to others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their excellency of Worthineſs. And in this largemotion, it ſeems the ſame with giving honour, and ſo it is due not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Superiors, but to equals and inferiors, for any Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Natural, Moral, or Political, that is in them, according to the Apoſtles Precept, <hi>Honour all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by others, the notion of Worſhip is made (and I think rightly) narrower than that of Honour, <hi>viz.</hi> a reſpect not meerly to anothers worth or excellence, but to his Superiority and Power over us, whether Natural, Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical, and ſuch an obſervance of him, as implies Subjection.</p>
                  <p>The higheſt kind of Worſhip, is that which is due to the higheſt Excellency and Soveraignity, and is called Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

                  <head>§ 2. <hi>Of Divine Worſhip in its more comprehenſive Senſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TO Worſhip God, is to yield him that obſervance which is his due, and his alone, according to his incommunicable Excellence, and Soveraingty over us, and his other tranſcendent Relations to us.</p>
                  <p>Our obſervance due to God alone, is our voluntary act of abſolute or unlimited ſubjection, and whatſoever is expreſſive thereof. All Divine Worſhip herein conſiſting, muſt needs be for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or kind, the higheſt that can be rendred; yet there are ſeveral parts or kinds thereof, that differ in the degrees of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64714:91"/>of the nature of this kind. Some partake thereof in a more noble and eminent, and others in an inferior way; and theſe are appendent and ſubſervient to the former.</p>
                  <p>Every Act of obedience to God, taken formally, is Divine Worſhip in a larger ſenſe; for every ſuch act conſidered formally, as obedience, is a direct rendring of that obſervance or honour to him, which is his due. Conſequently, Devotion towards God incompaſſeth the whole duty of man; for mans whole duty is of no larger extent than obſervance due to God.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe Acts which are the matter of our obſervance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, yet nextly and immediately reſpect our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or our ſelves; being materially and in themſelves conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, are not directly Religious or Divine Worſhip, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductively, as being imperated by Religion.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Worſhipping of God is the direct acknowledging of his being, and perfections, and ſoveraignty over us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to his honour. Conſequently, it is the yielding of ſuch honour to God, as no other being is capable of, becauſe his being and perfections, and ſupreminent Relations, are incommunicable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is no fit Queſtion, becauſe no matter of debate, Whether Divine Worſhip may be given to a Creature? But the queſtion concerning Worſhip given by ſome to a Creature, is, Whether it be Divine Worſhip, or that which belongs to God, or no? And if it be found to be that which belongs to God, it is evident without more ado, that it cannot be given to a Creature. For Gods Worſhip is communicable, no more than his excellency is.</p>
                  <p>But to the queſtion as ordinarily expreſs'd, Whether Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip may be given to a Creature? The anſwer is made, by diſtinguiſhing Religious Worſhip into the elicite, or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Acts of Religion. That Religious Worſhip in the latter ſenſe may be given to men, is paſt doubt. For all due Civil Worſhip is imperated by Religion: but the elicite Acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, being acts of Devotion due to God, as God, cannot be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64714:92"/>rendred to any Creature, nor any outward and imperate Act, immediately expreſſive thereof.</p>

                  <p>ALL kind of Worſhip, and conſequently the Worſhip of God, is divided into internal and external, according to the eſſential parts of man, internal and external, the Soul and the Body.</p>
                  <p>The internal Worſhip of God, is an Act of the Mind or Soul, whereby, according to the apprehenſion of his worthineſs, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains a worthy eſtimation of him, and hath complacence in him, and conſents to the due expreſſions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident, that the inmoſt and deepeſt part of Gods Worſhip, is a ſuperlative reverence and love of him.</p>
                  <p>The external Worſhip of God, is the direct and immediate expreſſion of the internal, by any outward Sign, Word, Geſture,</p>
                  <p>Action.</p>
                  <p>The internal is to the external, what the Soul is to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yea, it may be compleat Worſhip of it ſelf, as when the outward expreſſions cannot be performed, or are not requiſite.</p>
                  <p>The external without the internal, is a carkaſs without life. Nevertheleſs it is an Obſervance, or Worſhip, and hath its moral Eſtimation, or comes to account.</p>

                  <head>§ 5. <hi>Divine Worſhip diſtinguiſhed into Natural and Inſtituted. And firſt, of Natural Worſhip.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Worſhip of God is either natural or inſtituted. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Worſhip is that which in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and immediately, is founded in the Nature of God, and the Nature of man, and Gods relation to Man, and Mans relation to God.</p>
                  <p>And it is twofold, either that which is naturally neceſſary, or that which is naturally laudable. That which is naturally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, is indiſpenſable and unchangeable. That which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly laudable muſt be uſed whenſoever conveniently it may.</p>
                  <p>There is natural Worſhip due to God, both as the Creator of man, and as the Redeemer of fallen man.</p>
                  <p>As God is our Creator, he is our abſolute Owner, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and Benefactor; and as ſuch, he is to be acknowledged by us, with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64714:92"/>all due obſervance. And whatſoever Acts of obſervance towards God we are upon this ground immediately obliged unto, they are Natural Worſhip due to God as our Creator.</p>
                  <p>All Natural Worſhip due to God as Creator, is diſcernable by natural revelation, or the Book of Nature. In Nature intire, it was clearly and compleatly thereby diſcernable; but in Nature fallen, more dimly and defectively; yet not for want of objective evidence, but for the indiſpoſition of our faculty.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe to God our Redeemer, there is a Worſhip due from us, naturally and immediately ariſing from our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our relation to God therein founded. And it is (our redemption being ſuppoſed) no more of Gods arbitrary inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that Worſhip which is founded in the Law of our Creation, and primitive State.</p>
                  <p>To the knowledg of this ſort of Natural Worſhip, we come by means of that Divine revelation, by which we come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of our redeemed ſtate. But the knowledg of our redeemed ſtate being ſuppoſed, natural Reaſon will ſhew, that ſuch and ſuch Acts of obſervance in <hi>ſpecie</hi> are naturally and indiſpenſably due to God our Redeemer.</p>

                  <p>INſtituted Worſhip is that which depends in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon Gods free Will, and Arbitrary inſtitution. But the inſtitution being made and continuing, it is naturally and neceſſarily due to God, ſo far as he requires it, tho it be not immediately natural.

                  <head>§ 7. <hi>Of Moral and Ceremonial Worſhip.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis diſtinction being commonly uſed, muſt here be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. It is wholly coincident with the former. For that which is commonly called Moral, is for the moſt part, but not all of it, natural Worſhip; nor perhaps is all natural Worſhip to be called Moral; for there may be ſome natural Ceremonies, that is to ſay, naturally laudable, tho not abſolutely neceſſary. Nor
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64714:93"/>is all inſtituted Worſhip Ceremonial, but ſome is Moral, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the weekly Sabbath, or <hi>Lords day.</hi> Nor is all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Worſhip inſtituted. For beſides natural ceremonies, other ceremonious religious Acts may be uſed arbitrarily and occaſionally, and but once; indeed ſuch Acts may be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, as Inſtituted is oppoſed to Natural, but not as it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens ſtated or ſetled.</p>
                  <p>The word Moral is ambiguous, and, as I ſuppoſe, inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently uſed in this matter; as it alſo is, when uſed in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine Law into Moral and Ceremonial. For every Law is Moral, or <hi>circa mores;</hi> and all Worſhip is Moral, as being an Act of our behaviour conformable to the divine Law. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we muſt yield to uſe, which hath the dominion of words, and inquire into the meaning of this word in this point.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the word in this caſe is taken by them that uſe it, for that which is of perpetual right. But that this is not the adequate ſenſe, appears, for that ſome things not ceremonial, but eſteemed moral, are not perpetual. And there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſtinction between Moral natural, and Moral poſitive; and that Moral poſitive is not in the nature of the thing perpetual, is unqueſtionable; and it is evident, that ſome Moral poſitive is not <hi>de facto</hi> of perpetual right, as the old Seventh-day Sabbath; Concerning which day, tho there might be ſomething ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in the corporal reſt thereof, eſpecially under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſation; yet the obſerving of that meaſure of time, and that ſpecial day every week ſet a part for Gods ſolemn Worſhip, was not ceremonial, nor yet natural, but Moral poſitive, yet not perpetual. Beſides, there is nothing in the nature of the thing to hinder the perpetuity of ſome ceremonial Law or Worſhip, if it pleaſed God to perpetuate it. Yea, there are ſome ceremonial Ordinances of Divine Worſhip now inſtituted, that are to indure to the Conſummation of all things, namely, the two Sacraments of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beſt diſtinguiſhing-terms that I can find to expreſs what is generally meant by Moral and Ceremonial Worſhip, is, That the former is ſubſtantial, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd by it ſelf Divine Worſhip; the later is but a ſupplemental as an appurtenance to the former, the better to expreſs it, and ſet it off, and externally to compleat it. I ſuppoſe the term <hi>Complemental</hi> might here fitly enough be uſed but that it ſounds ill from the ſenſe which it hath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64714:93"/>uſe. And meer ceremonial perſons do indeed but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement with God, according to the common meaning of that word.</p>
                  <p>Tho ceremonial Worſhip be but ſupplemental to that which is called Moral and Subſtantial; yet being appointed of God, it is not to be lightly eſteemed, but to be valued according to its importance. And there be ſome parts or kinds thereof, that are of high importance in Religion, as the Sacraments and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifies under the the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>WOrſhip may be conſidered both as a generical, and as an integral whole, and accordingly it hath ſpecifical and integral parts. Every ſpecifical part or kind thereof, hath in it the common name and nature of the genus. And every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral part of the ſame ſpecies is homogenial, and hath the name and nature of that ſpecies. And the ſpecifically different parts may be conſidered as integral parts, and heterogenial, that go to the making up of one intire Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>It imports much to diſcern and diſtinguiſh rightly between Worſhip it ſelf, and the accidents thereof, without which it is not performable, or at leaſt not performable in due manner; ſuch as are, order, method, phraſe, or form of words, degree, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, time, place, furniture.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things appertain to Divine Worſhip, not in any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reaſon, but in common, as to all grave, civil or humane actions.</p>
                  <p>Nor do theſe things immediately and directly reſpect God and his Honour, to whom the Worſhip is directed; but Man and his convenience, by whom the Worſhip is performed.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs God and his Honour is concerned in them, in as much as he is concerned that men be ſet in all convenient circumſtances for his Worſhip, and therefore ultimately they reſpect him, and they are to be uſed for the hallowing of his name.</p>
                  <p>I take not this to be any conſtitutive, or conſecutive diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Worſhip it ſelf, and its adjuncts, that the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64714:94"/>one makes acceptable to God, and is a means of Grace from him, and the other not. For I conceive both the one and the other may have this effect, tho not in equal degree.</p>
                  <p>Tho Ceremonial Worſhip be but an appurtenance of that which is called Moral; yet it is truly a ſpecies of Worſhip, as having the common nature of Worſhip in it. Howbeit, it is but an Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpecies, as having the nature of its genus, but in an inferior way.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE acts of Religion that are Moral Natural Worſhip, are the hearing of Gods word with heart-ſubjection; prayer, comprehending confeſſion of our ſin and miſery; petition for all needful grace and mercy; and praiſe, with thankſgiving; ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to God, and covenanting with him; making vows to him; ſwearing by his name; and devoting any thing to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Service. All theſe are expreſſions of divine honour.</p>
                  <p>Of all theſe there may be certain external forms of poſitive inſtitution, and ſo as to thoſe forms they may be called inſtituted worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the thing vowed may be inſtituted and ceremonial, tho the vow of it ſelf be Moral Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The end of an Oath may be the confirmation of the truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men; and the neareſt end of a Vow to God, may be ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to men; and the matter of a Vow may be ſome common thing; yet the Vow, as to its eſſential form, is divine Worſhip in a direct engagement made to God for his honour; and an oath as to its eſſential form, is divine worſhip in a direct acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Omnipotence, Omniſcience, infinite Holineſs, and taking him to witneſs to the truth which we atteſt, with a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſubjection to his righteous judgment. And the internal end of both Vow and Oath, is the glorifying of God as our Supreme Lord and Judg.</p>
                  <p>The external part of the Sacraments both of the Old and New Teſtament, is inſtituted ceremonial worſhip; but the internal part, which is the ſoul and ſpirit thereof, being our ſolemn receiving of the grace of the Covenant given us of God in Chriſt, and our ſolemn engaging to God according to the tenor of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is a moſt important and main part of divine ſervice, and is worſhip Moral, Natural.</p>

                  <p>KNeeling, bowing of the body, proſtration, lifting up of the hands and eyes to heaven in worſhipping God, are in one reſpect worſhip it ſelf, and in another reſpect but circumſtances of Worſhip. They are acts of external Worſhip as they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural expreſſions of the internal. And they may be accounted and called circumſtances of Worſhip, being conſidered as ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient appurtenances to the more ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip, to which they are ſometimes neceſſarily conjoined, and from which remaining intire and compleat notwithſtanding, they may at other times be ſpared. Theſe things being naturally laudable, but not naturally neceſſary, are neceſſary to be uſed when conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently they may, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Some have called the aforeſaid, and ſuch like external acts, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ceremonies; and they are called Natural, becauſe Nature it ſelf teacheth men to uſe them, without any Divine or Humane inſtitution; and a rational man by the meer light of Nature, is directed to uſe them; yet men are by nature directed to things not without government of counſel and diſcretion. For in theſe things Nature is in part determined and limited by the cuſtom of ſeveral Ages and Countreys, and by the difference of ſeveral caſes.</p>
                  <p>The poſture of Standing in the acts of ſolemn profeſſions and engagements made to God, as in declaring our aſſent to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith, and conſent to the Covenant of Grace; alſo in acts of ſolemn Praiſe and Thankſgiving, as in the repeating of Laudatory Hymns, is ſuch an outward expreſſion of our internal devotion, as is very conſentaneous to Nature, and ſo an outward act of Worſhip.</p>

                  <p>THE erecting of Altars, offering of Sacrifice, and burning of incenſe, are by the cuſtom of mankind accounted Divine Honours. And they were ſuch acknowledgments as God did in the Law appropriate to himſelf. Therefore theſe acts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly divine worſhip to whatſoever object they are directed. Yea, tho there be not an intention of acknowledging a Deity in the object or perſon to whom they are directed; yet they are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Divine Worſhip, or a giving of that external honour which is appropriated to the Deity.</p>
                  <p>The dedicating of Temples, and conſecrating of places to any being, may be of ambiguous interpretation. Firſt, it may betoken the ſetting apart a place as ſacred to that being, to which it is ſet apart, and the place of its worſhip, and ſpecial reſidence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influence upon mortals; and in this ſenſe it is an act of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip; and in this ſenſe I ſuppoſe the Papiſts have dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches and Chappels, and other places, to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. 2. It may betoken only the ſetting apart of a place or houſe in memorial only of the created perſon, Saint or Angel, but to the honour and ſervice of God. And in this later ſenſe the dedicating of a Church or other place to a created being, is not a deferring of divine honour thereunto.</p>
                  <p>In like manner the dedicating of days and times to any perſon for invocation, or any ſervice which is uſually rendred to God, to be performed to that perſon, is a giving of divine worſhip to him. But the dedicating of days and times in memorial of ſome bleſſed perſon, to the honour and ſervice of God alone, is no giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine worſhip to that perſon.</p>

                  <p>THat the <hi>formale</hi> of theſe Vows, as of all others, is Divine Worſhip, is not doubted; the inquiry therefore is of the ſubject matter thereof.</p>
                  <p>By the matter of theſe Vows the aſſerters thereof intend a ſpecial religious ſtate over and above the general religious ſtate, which is Chriſtianity it ſelf; which ſpecial ſtate contains an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to certain offices and works to be done, intended for the direct and immediate honouring and ſerving of God, and that in a more ſublime and perfect way than Chriſtianity in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and ſo they are made direct matter of devotion or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Apoſtles rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> is of the law of nature, and would have obliged the Churches of Chriſt, tho it had not been written in the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Decency as ſuch, is no part of Worſhip, but an adjunct; it is the convenient ſetting it off, or a mode thereof agreeable to its dignity. And it is not proper to it alone, but common to all Civil matters and Humane actions of a grave nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that it be performed in a meet habit, and poſture of Body, and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and other like ſignifications of due reſpect to a holy action.</p>
                  <p>Order likewiſe is an adjunct of Worſhip, and is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the making of new Worſhip; for that it is no other than the due diſpoſing of what is already made, and the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſetting and ranking of the ſeveral parts thereof, for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, Meaſure, Time, Place, and other circumſtances. And it belongs to Divine Worſhip, not on a peculiar, but common reaſon, as to all humane actions, wherein order is both beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and advantageous, and diſorder is deformed and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles ſaid Rule, intends that neceſſary Decency and Order, the want whereof is undecency and diſorder; but not Gaudy dreſſes, Theatrical ornaments, Pompous formalities, Imagery, and Various flouriſhes, affected by the ſenſual fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Such Decency is injoyned as is ſuitable to things of a holy and reverend Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:64714:96"/>
                  <p>We may know what is injoyned in a Law, by what is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forbidden. Now in this Law nothing is forbidden, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency and diſorder; and therefore nothing is injoyned but the neceſſary Decency and Order oppoſite thereunto. And in plain reaſon, whatſoever is not undecent, is decent; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not diſorderly, is orderly; I mean in a capable ſubject of theſe adjuncts.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Matters of Decency and Order, are ſimply neceſſary on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in genere,</hi> but not <hi>in ſpecie</hi> any further, but that ſome ſpecies or other under the genus is to be made uſe of according to prudence.</p>
                  <p>Some particular ſpecies of Decency are in themſelves neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when they are poſſible; and they are thoſe whoſe oppoſites are undecent from the nature of the things. Some are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from extrinſecal circumſtances, as from cuſtome of the Time and Place, the Quality and Condition of perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The former kind may be called Natural, the later Civil or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary. And the later ſort are neceſſary even by the Law of Nature, yet not immediately, but mediately, ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being ſuppoſed. But this ſort admits of much variety and alteration.</p>
                  <p>Leſs decent hath the nature of undecent, when it it choſen in oppoſition to more decent; as leſs good hath the nature of evil, when it is choſen in oppoſition to greater good. But here it is not fit nor ſafe to contend about <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> nor to ſtrain to the uttermoſt pitch in things that are matter of Controrveſie, or Scruple, or Jealouſie; but it is beſt to take up with that which is moſt paſſable among all, provided there be no ſimple undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: For then in that caſe no neceſſary Decency is neglected.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>TIME and Place in general are neceſſary Adjuncts or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Divine Worſhip. For no action Natural or Moral, can be performed without them. And they are meer Adjuncts, when they attend Divine Worſhip in a way and reaſon common to it with other humane Actions, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and uſed about it, according to convenience for the due performance of it. And then they are only for the Worſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64714:97"/>therein, but the Worſhip is not from them.</p>
                  <p>But Time and Place in Gods Worſhip ſometimes have a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtate, and become the matter thereof, as the old Sabbath, and the Lords day, and the Tabernacle, and Temple, under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſation. For as God by his Inſtitution did make thoſe Times and Places not occaſionally but ſtatedly holy, and a means of ſanctifying his people; ſo his people in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his appointment, and their very Dedication and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or Sanctifying of thoſe Times and Places, did perform ſpecial Acts of Worſhip, being an Oblation to God, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate giving of honour to him. And thoſe Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not only ſanctified by the duties therein performed, but the duties were partly ſanctified, and made acceptable by thoſe Times and Places.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit thoſe ſacred Times and Places, that have been advanced to be matter of Worſhip, are alſo in that ſtate of advancement Adjuncts to that Worſhip to which they appertain, and are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated. For there is that inferiority and ſuperiority in ſeveral parts of Worſhip, that ſome may be rightly accounted adjuncts to others.</p>
                  <p>As God by his Inſtitution can make Times and Places, that of themſelves are but meer Adjuncts, to be matter of his Worſhip, and hath done it in the forementioned inſtances; ſo men alſo may by their Inſtitutions make Times and Places ſtatedly or permanently Holy, and matter of Worſhip, and an Oblation to God. How lawfully they may do ſo, is afterwards to be conſidered; but however the dedicating and obſerving thereof hath the Nature of Worſhip in it. For the efficient cauſe, Whether it be God or Man, is extrinſecal to the formal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Worſhip, which lies in the formal Reaſon, and direct and proper end and uſe of the action, by whomſoever inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be conſidered, Whether every Adjucnt of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip inſtituted of God, doth by that Inſtitution become a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or part of Worſhip, which otherwiſe it would not be. Some ſay that in the old Law, the leaſt ceremony preſcribed of God, was a part of Worſhip. Which Aſſertion I do not now ſo far examine, as to declare my aſſent or diſſent. But if it were ſo, I think it was not meerly as preſcribed of God, but upon ſome further Reaſon. For I do not ſee that God cannot preſcribe a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64714:97"/>meer adjunct of Worſhip, but it muſt thereby loſe its formal ſtate, or become formally another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a matter of Worſhip; but think it may remain in its own ſtate, a meer Adjunct ſtill. Nevertheleſs, the obſervation of that divinely preſcribed Adjunct, may be an act of Worſhip ſo far, as every act of obedience to God as ſuch, may be ſo called. But here we ſpeak of Worſhip, not in ſo large, but in the ſtricter ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>A Sign is ſomething more known, ſhewing another thing leſs known; or that which is more open, diſcovering ſomething more latent; or at leaſt, that which doth further clear and confirm the truth of what is alike evident.</p>
                  <p>There are Signs natural, and cuſtomary, and inſtituted, and arbitrary, and ſtated, and occaſional.</p>

                  <p>HOlineſs in Creatures ſignifies, either a quality in Angels and Men, which is called the Image of God; or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any thing to God, as appropriated to him.</p>
                  <p>In a general ſence, all things in heaven and earth are the Lords: but whatſoever is his in a ſpecial ſence, or ſeparated to his uſe, is called holy: As firſt, perſons, either more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally devoted to him, and that heartily, as all the faithful and their ſeed; or profeſſedly, as all viſible Chriſtians; or elſe, by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64714:98"/>ſpecial Office, as the Prieſts of old, and now the Miniſters of the Goſpel. 2ly. Things, ſome by his own immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; others by general directions to Men: and of theſe, ſome are more remotely, others more nearly ſet apart unto him. Things more nearly, or ſtrictly devoted to God, are Temples, Utenſils, Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Holy, being juſtly related to God by lawful Separation. Miniſters are more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than theſe, becauſe more nearly related to God. Things remotely, or more at large devoted to God, are the Meat, Drink, Houſe, Lands, Labours, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of every one that is godly, who with himſelf devotes all that he hath to God.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, as every thing is ſanctified of God to a Believer, ſo every thing is ſanctified by a Believer unto God. But the holineſs of things is ordinarily underſtood, of things not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely, and at large, and ultimately, but more nearly, and in a ſtricter ſence devoted to God.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, ſuch a ſtate of Separation to holy uſes, that the thing may no more be alienated, is proper holineſs. But others think this too narrow a deſcription. For there may be a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Separation, as well as perpetual to holy uſes, as here ſtrictly taken for thoſe onely that more nearly reſpect God's Worſhip and Service; and not for all uſes, ultimately reſpecting God's Honour; in which larger ſence, by the Holy, all things (as hath been ſaid) are uſed to holy uſes. Some ſay, That thoſe things are not ſacred, that accompany Religious Worſhip in a way common to it with other things, as Time, Place, Furniture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Things uſed in Religious Services, may be civil in their own Nature, and they do not then alter their Matter, or Form, but onely their Subject, to which they are Adjuncts. To which it is anſwered, That things conſidered in their own nature, that is, Phyſically, are neither civil nor ſacred, but are either the one or the other, according to their relation and application. Therefore many things of the ſame ſpecies Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically conſidered, may be ſometimes Civil, and ſometimes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, according to their different uſe and relation, as the ſame Phyſical act that is but civil reverence in a civil affair, may be religious reverence in a religious Service. They accompany Religion in a way common to it, with other actions, Phyſically, but not Morally, or Relatively. And whereas it is ſaid, they are of the ſame uſe out of God's ſervice, as in it; as there is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64714:98"/>the ſame uſe of mens eyes in reading one Book, as in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another: The Anſwer is, They are of the ſame uſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, but not Relatively, and Morally.</p>
                  <p>For explaining the former Paragraph, be it noted, That Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſuppoſeth civility, and conſequently holy things and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require civil things and actions as inferior attendants thereon. Religious Worſhip, or Divine Service, muſt needs be accompanied with many things of a meer civil import, which do not thereupon alter their ſtate from civil to ſacred; as the civil Habits both of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and People, the civil order of their ſitting according to their ſeveral ranks; and other civil decencies obſerved in holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that ſtill remain but meer civilities. For they are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, nor related to Religion as adjuncts to a Subject; nor are referred to a holy uſe, or end; otherwiſe then as all things are referred ultimately to a holy end: onely they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to accompany Religion in their lower ſtate of Civility. Nevertheleſs there be many things, which in civil affairs are meerly civil, yet in Religious Exerciſes are Religious, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſtate being altered, for that they are directly applied to a religious or holy uſe and end; as bowing of the Body, lifting up the Hand, or the Eyes, ſtanding up, being Phyſically the ſame, are Sacred actions, being applied to Divine worſhip; and civil, when applied to civil repects.</p>
                  <p>Every thing ſhould be reverenced according to the Degree and Meaſure of its Holineſs.</p>

                  <p>AS there is a defect in Religion, ſo there is an exceſs, and this is called Superſtition.</p>
                  <p>This exceſs is not in the formal reaſon of Religion (for we cannot too much obſerve, reverence, and love God) but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64714:99"/>either in the undueneſs of the object, or the acts thereof, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or External. Exceſs in the undueneſs of the object of Religious Worſhip, is Idolatry. Exceſs in the Internal acts thereof, lies in the inward anxiety, ſcrupuloſity, or other exorbitant fancy about it.</p>
                  <p>The Exceſs in the External acts, is either in the Kind, or the Meaſure thereof; in the Kind, as being forbidden either in particular, or in general; in the meaſure, of what for the Kind is lawful, as when it is to the neglect of other duties.</p>
                  <p>The Exceſs is more rare in natural, than in inſtituted, or poſitive Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>To be too religious, is in ſome reſpect to be irreligious; it is ſometimes Sacrilegious, in robbing God of his due in other kinds; and at all times it wants the formal nature of True Religion.</p>
                  <p>Superſtition is either poſitive, in forbidden acts of Worſhip; or negative, in religious abſtainings from things not forbidden, as ſome diſtinguiſh. But I conceive, that in this latter kind the <hi>formale</hi> of Superſtition lyes not in a negation, or meer not doing, but in a certain obſervance about not doing, and a conſcientious nolition.</p>

                  <p>IDolatry is a ſpecies of Superſtition, being an exceſs in the object of Worſhip. It is the giving of Worſhip, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God, to that which is not God.</p>
                  <p>An Idol in its moſt proper ſence, is an Image, that is the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or reſemblance of any Being; more eſpecially, that which is made for the reſemblance of the true, or a falſe God.

                  <p>Moreover, an Idol is not onely that, which beſides the true God is avowed for God; but alſo that, which hath any part or kind of Divine Honour given to it; for it is thereby made <hi>interpretative</hi> another God.</p>
                  <p>If any incommunicable Attribute of God be given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Omniſcience, or to be the ſearcher of hearts, that other is made another God, though not ſimply, yet <gap reason="foreign">

                  </head>
                  <p>SErious Idolatry is, when the mind gives the honour due to God, or any part thereof, to a Being that is not God; and when the uſing of the External ſigns of that honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the intention of the mind to honour it thereby.</p>
                  <p>In all ſerious or undiſſembled Idolatry, there is ignorance or error about the object, or the act of Worſhip. Firſt, about the object; either the thing worſhipped is taken to be God, when it is not God; or it is taken to have ſome Attribute of God, which it hath not, or to injoy ſome Prerogative of God, which it doth not. In the Two later caſes the thing is worſhipped, though not ſimply, yet <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, About the act of Worſhip, 1. When the worſhip given to that which is not God, is not taken to be Divine Worſhip, when indeed it is ſuch. 2. When the Worſhip taken to be Divine, is not taken to be applyed to the object, when indeed it is applyed.</p>
                  <p>Diſſembled Idolatry, is meerly External, when an External Sign of Honour due to God alone is given to that, which is not God, without the intention of the mind to honour it thereby.</p>
                  <p>Every outward act, that is ordinarily uſed for ſignification of Divine Honour, is not of it ſelf, as Phyſically conſidered, a ſignification thereof, and conſequently not Idolatry. But whenſoever ſuch an act is knowingly and voluntarily done, at ſuch time and place, and in ſuch circumſtances as make it to be taken for a ſignification of Divine Honour, it is imputed to him that doth it for a ſignification thereof. Though it be true, That that which is not a ſign of Internal Honour, is not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; nevertheleſs, he that doth not internally honour, may
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64714:100"/>give the outward ſign of doing it. He doth really give the ſign of ſuch honour, though but a feigned one, and ſo is really guilty of Idolatry, though but diſſembled. He doth really make ſhew of giving that honour to another, which is due to God onely, and profeſſedly owns another object of Divine worſhip, and ſo far an other God. And though it be not Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet it is Corporal Idolatry, as an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or impious perſon doth not Internally Honour God, but contemn him; yet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things which are External Signs thereof, he doth Externally worſhip God.</p>

                  <p>THat the <hi>Papiſts</hi> give Divine Worſhip to the Hoſt, is by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledged; and it is no ſmall part of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>This, according to the Proteſtants Doctrine, is the giving of Divine Honour to a morſel of Bread; and therefore a moſt ſtupid, and ſtupendious kind of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion have gone about to Extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſame, ſaying, That it is material, but not formal Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For that the Conſecrated Bread is taken to be very Chriſt, who is very God; and therefore, though the thing Worſhipped be not God, yet it is Believed to be the True God by thoſe Worſhippers, and Worſhipped as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, it hath been granted by ſome of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers, That if the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> be an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, they are guilty of the moſt abominable Idolatry in the Adoration of the Hoſt; and they could not find out the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid extenuation of it, in caſe of ſuch Error, by diſtinguiſhing between Material and Formal Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>And ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do ſay, That theſe words, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> may bear a Figurative ſence; as thoſe Words, That <hi>Chriſt was a Rock:</hi> and that if there were no other Evidence for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but what the Scripture gives, there were no reaſon to make it an Article of Faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Theſe words neceſſarily infer either a real Mutation in the Bread, as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64714:101"/>hold; or a Metaphorical, as the Calviniſts hold; but by no means admit the Lutheran ſence.</hi> And he concludes, That though there be ſome obſcurity and ambiguity in the Words, yet it is taken away by Councils and Fathers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi> in old Gentiliſm, Worſhipped the <hi>Sun</hi> for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God; and their Idolatry was not the leſs abominable for their Error about that Object of Worſhip. And ſurely it was Formal Idolatry; that is, There was in it the <hi>formalis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> or true nature and reaſon of that Sin.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I think it more Sacrilegious, and Blaſphemous againſt the True God, to take any Creature to be he, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it accordingly, than to give Divine Worſhip to a Creature not imagined to be the Supreme God, but ſome inferior deity.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks in his Preface to his Sermon on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. of certain Hereticks that honoured the <hi>Sun,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That it was Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now divine honour given to the <hi>Sun</hi> under ſuch a miſtake, is horrid Idolatry; and why not alſo divine honour given to a morſel of Bread by the ſame miſtake?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> doth not infer that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is to be adored. They believe indeed, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is really preſent in the Sacrament;</hi> but they do not believe, That the Sacrament is really Jeſus Chriſt, nor adore it as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>But that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> condition in reſpect of this ſottiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of Bread-worſhip being ſo bad, may not be made worſe than it is, it may be conſidered, That they do not take the Bread to be the Deity, nor to be he that is God, ſave onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Human Body, into which they believe the Bread is changed, and ſo worſhip it as our Lords Body; or to expreſs it in the moſt favourable ſence, they worſhip him as there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his proper Body; and withal, worſhip the bread ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be that Body.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis Invocation is without Precept or Precedent in Holy Scripture. Invocation on God alone is according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Chriſt teacheth, to pray, <hi>Our Father,</hi> in his great Rule and Standard of Prayer. We are taught to Invocate him, on
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64714:101"/>whom we believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. which is God alone. As In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the Type, ſo Prayer the thing typified, is to be offered to God alone.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is an Act of ſuch Worſhip as Papiſts call <hi>latria.</hi> It ſuppoſeth the Being to whom it is directed, to be the Author and Fountain of the good we pray for. And ſo they that are prayed to, are invocated in Gods ſtead. And whereas ſome ſay, That the Saints are to be invocated, not as Authors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benefits; it is apparent that Papiſts invocate them as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors directly and without ambages, praying to them for health and deliverance from danger, yea for the higheſt benefits, as to St. <hi>Peter</hi> to open Heaven Gates to them. They direct their prayers to them as to thoſe that can diſpence the Grace of God to men at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Alſo prayer implies a proſtration of the whole Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Body, to the perſon that is invocated, by Acts of Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Devotion, Dependence, Reverence, and all higeſt Obſervance. Experience ſhews the fond raviſhments of Soul in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions towards thoſe to whom more eſpecially they are devoted, ordinarily making no inferior Expreſſions of their Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, than toward God and Chriſt: Yea, they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted and taken up by this Dotage, as to forget God.</p>
                  <p>If Saints are invocated as Mediators, they are invocated in Chriſts ſtead. Chriſt is our Interceſſor in Heaven, as our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. And therefore they that are not our Redeemers, cannot be our interceſſors in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we cannot rationally commend our prayers to any but ſuch, as we know both can, and will repreſent them to God.</p>
                  <p>The Popiſh Invocation of Saints and Angels, is an aſcribing to them the incommunicable Excellencies of God, as to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To excuſe this Sacriledg and Idolatry, that incredible conceit of the Saints beholding all things, <hi>in ſpeculo Trinitatis,</hi> is but a ſorry ſhift. Such Omniſcience the Manhood of Chriſt hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically united to the Godhead, did not pretend unto. And the deviſing of it, is a tranſcendent preſumption of mans wit, for the invading of Gods right.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:64714:102"/>
                  <p>The truth is, the Worſhip of Saints and Angels maintained in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in parity of reaſon anſwers the <hi>Pagans</hi> Worſhipping of <hi>Daemons,</hi> being either Souls of Men departed, or other Inviſible Powers, whom they imagined to be Inferior Deities ſubordinate and miniſtring to the Supreme God.

                  <p>THoſe external Acts, that by Nature or Cuſtome, or Divine Inſtitution, are or were appropriated Expreſſions of that internal honour or obſervance that is due to God alone, are Divine Worſhip. And ſuch are the Acts of Erecting Altars, and bringing Oblations, and burning Incenſe, and making Vows, and dedicating Temples, and ordaining Feſtivals.</p>
                  <p>The Erecting of Altars, either for Sacrifice or other Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to any being, imports either an apprehenſion of that being, as an avenger of ſin in a higher way than mans temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Vengeance, and the propitiating thereof towards us; or elſe a grateful acknowledgment of benefits received from a higher hand, than any humane Benefactor upon Earth, even from a ſoveraign providence. And that which is ſo propitiated, or gratefully acknowledged, muſt be either the Supreme God, or ſome Inferior Deity, to which that is aſcribed, which the moſt High God hath not communicated to any other.</p>
                  <p>And beſides the reaſon of the thing, the cuſtom of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and Divine Ordination, hath made this a proper Act of Divine Worſhip.

                  <p>Nay, tho God hath now relinquiſhed ſuch a Mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as Altars properly ſo called, and Sacrifices, and Oblations, Propitiatory or Euchariſtical, (the reaſon of them ceaſing by the new Diſpenſation); yet it is Idolatrous to uſe the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards towards a Creature. For tho it be diſuſed in Divine Service, yet ſtill it hath the Impreſs or Signification of Divine honour.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Erecting of Altars and bringing Oblations to any beſides God, is Idolatry.</p>

                  <p>BOth Divine Ordination, and the Cuſtom of Nations, hath made the making of Vows a proper act of Divine Worſhip; and therefore when it is directed to any Creature, it is Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>In the reaſon of the thing, Vowing is an act of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>Vowing to God imports Heart-Subjection and Devotion to him, and truſt in him as the Soveraign diſpoſer of us and our concernments.</p>
                  <p>Vehement and reſolute Promiſes made to men upon Earth, may Metaphorically be called Vows to them. And things ſet apart for the uſe and Service of ſome perſons only, may in like manner of ſpeaking be ſaid to be devoted to them.</p>
                  <p>The Popiſh Vows made to Saints departed, are of the ſame reaſon with Vows made to God, importing that Subjection, Devotion and Dependence, which is due to God alone, and therefore are Idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the very matter of Vows made to Saints, are matters of Religious obſervance, or Devotion towards them, as of Invocation, Oblations, Dedication of Temples to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes the matter of ſuch Vows may be ſomething to be performed to men upon Earth, as for one to Vow to a Saint, that he will give ſo much to the Poor; and even in this later caſe the Vow <hi>quoad formale</hi> is a religious Subjection or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance towards the Saint, as an Inviſible Celeſtial power, in expectation of favour from him in caſe of performance, and of vengeance in caſe of failing therein.</p>
                  <p>It will not excuſe theſe Popiſh Votaries to ſay, That in Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Saints they do not imply an <hi>Obſequium</hi> or Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64714:103"/>them, as the firſt Principle or Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they ſay is <hi>latria;</hi> nor an expectation of favour or vengeance from them, as their abſolute Supreme Governours, and diſpoſers of them and their Affairs; but only as Inferior to God. For the things which God challenges to himſelf, they render to the Saints, (tho pretendedly but in an inferior reſpect), as namely, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Soul and Spirit, the Subjection of the Conſcience to them, and Dependence on them, as cauſes of good or evil in a Supernatural, tranſcendent, and Divine manner of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It was one kind of the Idolatry of the old Heathens, to Erect Altars, and make Vows, and Prayers, and offer Sacrifices to ſuch as they knew were not the Supreme God, but the Souls of men departed, or other <hi>Daemons.</hi> And Idolatry was rare among the <hi>Romans,</hi> if this were not Idolatry.

And indeed they have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the names <hi>Divi</hi> and <hi>Divae</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to make Vows to Saints, ſuppoſeth them capable of receiving Vows, and that capacity ſuppoſeth them to know all things on Earth, or at leaſt all things whenſoever and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever directed to them, even the ſecret intents of the heart; and this makes them Gods <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>No doubt a reſpect may be had to the true Reliques of Saints, as we reſpect the Reliques of dear Friends, or of Anceſtors, or of worthy Patriots or Princes, as ſome remaining Monuments of thoſe that have left the World.</p>

                     <hi>STaurolatry</hi> is Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>It is a queſtion with me, Whether many of the Papiſts can mean by the worſhipping of the Croſs, and of Reliques, any more than high veneration, or reverend reſpect. Surely they are not all ſo ſtupid as to pray to them, or to expect help from them, as from principal agents, but only as from inſtruments or means.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is no ground of veneration or reverence to the Croſs for its relation to Chriſt: For it was the inſtrument of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of his Murtherers. And the Croſs did not bring ſalvation, as a cauſe thereof, any more than the men that crucified Chriſt. Chriſt overcame not by the Croſs, but on the Croſs, it being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the proper, and not in a figurative ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi>'s glorying in the Croſs of Chriſt, is to be taken tropically for Chriſt as crucified.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if the Croſs properly taken, were to be gloried in, it doth not follow that it, it to be reverenced, much leſs adored. One may glory in a ſhameful ſuffering for Chriſt; and yet the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not to be adored nor reverenced.</p>

                  <head>§ 13. <hi>Whether Chriſt as Man, or Mediator, is to be worſhipped.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>LET it be conſidered, 1. There is but one immediate, formal, and adequate reaſon of Divine Worſhip, to wit, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Majeſty, independent and infinite excellency of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Godhead. 2. All Divine Worſhip is, for the nature of it, the higheſt obſervance and honour that can be given, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal object, and the adequate reaſon or ground of it, is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and infinite Excellence and Soveraignty. 3. Tho in Chriſt the Mediator the Godhead be neceſſary to mediation; yet mediation is not neceſſary to the Godhead. 4. Our Faith doth not reſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and finally, but mediately on Chriſt, as he is our Mediator God-man. 5. Chriſts Mediatory power and glory as God-man, is different from his natural and eſſential power and glory.</p>
                  <p>Now to anſwer the queſtion, That Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator God-man, is to be worſhipped, appears plainly from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3, 9. But from the aforegoing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64714:104"/>conſideration it is evinced, that he is Worſhipped with Divine Worſhip, not as Mediator, but as God. Chriſt as Mediator is the material or terminative, but not the formal object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For if upon ſuppoſition of what cannot be, our Mediator had not been God, he could not have been Worſhipped with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip. That God ſhould communicate the honour due to him, as God to another that is not God, is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Chriſt is Worſhipped as Mediator, if we take as Mediator <hi>ſpecificative</hi> to denote the perſon Worſhipped, and not <hi>reduplicative</hi> to denote the formal reaſon of his being Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. Therefore Divine Worſhip aſcribed as due to Chriſt, invincibly proves his Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>Tho the Office of Chriſt, and the diſcharging of it, be not the formal ground, yet it is an excellent motive to give him that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is due to his Infinite Excellence and Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>When any one ſaith, <hi>Lord Jeſus pray for me,</hi> the prayer is directed to him as God, tho the buſineſs recommended to him, is performed by him as man. And withal note, that we deſire him to intercede for us, in a way becoming the coeſſential Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is adored, not as Judg <hi>reduplicative,</hi> but becauſe he is Judg, and becauſe the Godhead judgeth principally, but the Manhood only by inſtrumental concurrence and Aſſociation.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt in his Mediatory Office doth put forth Divine Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not as in ſuch an Office <hi>formaliter,</hi> and immediately, but as it is ſeated in a Divine perſon. 2ly. Some further anſwer, That the Divine Operations ſo put forth, are impulſive cauſes, but not formal reaſons of Adoration.</p>
                  <p>In what reſpect the Divinity is communicated to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, in that reſpect Divine Worſhip is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thereunto, that is, in reſpect of Hypoſtatical Union. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity withal its adorable Attributes, is hypoſtatically reſiding in the Humanity. And the Man Chriſt Jeſus is Worſhipped not as man, but as hypoſtatically united to the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>When we Worſhip Chriſt, our Worſhip is terminated on his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>§ 14. <hi>Of Worſhipping Images, or of Idolatry in the Mediate object of Worſhip.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AN Image is the likeneſs or reſemblance of any thing. And the uſe of it in Religious Worſhip, is to repreſent that whoſe Image it is.</p>
                  <p>More largely, an Image may be taken for that which repreſents another thing, tho not ſuppoſed to be the likeneſs thereof, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof is given in an unhewn Stone for <hi>Neptune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Symbol of preſence is not the ſame thing with an Image. For only the preſence of a thing after a fort is denoted by the one; but the other preſents the thing it ſelf. Therefore God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Symbols of his preſence, but forbad the making of any Image of him.</p>
                  <p>The Worſhipping of an Image may be conſidered, either as giving Worſhip to the matter of it, which is Wood, Stone, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to the object repreſented by it, a ſuppoſed Deity.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, a material Image may be conceited to be more than a meer Image or repreſenting likeneſs, and taken for an animated body, or an incorporated Deity, and the Worſhip may be directed both to the material, and the inviſible ſubſtance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to a compound conſiſting of Body and Soul.</p>
                  <p>The Worſhip given to a meer Image, cannot be underſtood to be given to it, in regard of its phyſical ſubſtance, as it is Wood or Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but meerly upon the account of its reſembling and repreſenting the Prototype. And it is Worſhipped not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely as the ultimately terminating object; but relatively, as a medium or mediate object; and no rational Idolater can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more to an Image. Wherfore the Prototype is Worſhipped in it, and the Worſhip paſſeth through it to the Prototype as to the ultimate object.</p>
                  <p>And conſequent to this it is, that the Worſhip given to the Image, muſt be of the ſame kind with that which is given to the Prototype, yet given to the Image but improperly, and relatively; for if it be of another kind, it doth terminate in the Image it ſelf, and doth not by the Image paſs to the ultimate object.</p>
                  <p>The Worſhippers of Images are not agreed, what Worſhip is due to them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, The Worſhip that is due to an Image properly by it ſelf, as terminating the Worſhip, is a kind
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64714:105"/>of imperfect analogical Worſhip reductive to the Worſhip due to the Exemplar, which is neither <hi>latria,</hi> nor <hi>hyperdulia,</hi> nor <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> but is reduced to them as imperfect to the perfect.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that for image-worſhippers to avoid Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is requiſite that they underſtand theſe diſtinctions of <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, dulia, hyperdulia,</hi> by it ſelf, and by accident, properly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, ſimply, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> analogically, reductively. And is this ſafe proviſion for the ſouls of men, that they may not incur the anger of the jealous God, by the provoking-ſin of idolatry, and all to ſet up a Worſhip that is needleſs?</p>
                  <p>A meer inanimate thing can have no kind of excellence in it ſelf to deſerve Worſhip from us men; nor any reverence as the abſolute and properly terminating object thereof; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a meer material image cannot be rationally intended for ſuch an object of worſhip. But if the image be taken for an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate body, or an incorporated Deity, then it is an abſolutely ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating object of the worſhip performed to it.</p>
                  <p>Worſhipping towards a Symbolical preſence, is not a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the ſymbol, as the bowing to the throne of a Prince, is not a worſhipping of the throne. And ſo the bowing towards the Mercy-ſeat in the moſt holy place, was not a worſhipping thereof. It was <hi>medium cultus,</hi> but not <hi>medium cultum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The idolatry of image-worſhip is moſt frequently ſpoken of in Scripture, becauſe it was moſt ordinary; and it is the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of almoſt all other kinds of idolatry. For both the true and falſe gods are by idolaters commonly worſhipped in images. I ſhall conſider this kind of idolatry, firſt as it is uſed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of falſe gods, and then as it is uſed in the worſhip of the true God.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AMong the Heathens, the images of their gods were called gods, not properly, but tropically; as the Picture of a man is called a Man; for humane underſtanding cannot take a meer ſtatue, or a picture, for a god. Therefore as to this point the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were as juſtifiable as the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>The Heathens thought that the ſpecial reſidences of their gods were in the images, and that their power was exerted by them. So do the Papiſts take their Sacred images for the ſpecial reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64714:106"/>as of God, and of Chriſt, ſo of the Saints and Angels, which they alſo worſhip with the worſhip due to God only, and ſo make them idols.</p>
                  <p>The Devil by Gods permiſſion was wont to dwell and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in certain images, by which means they came to be famous, and more adored than others. So the Papiſts think a divine or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural efficacy to be tyed to one image, more than to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Vulgar Heathens being infatuated by Satanical illuſions, might without much difficulty be brought in part to terminate their worſhip in the images themſelves, being ſet forth and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they were, to aſtoniſh the beholders, and raiſe fear in them, that they might apprehend them the very gods which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, but not the whole of them, but only as it were the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, where with the inviſible Deities did incorporate. And mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ignorant vulgar Papiſts m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upon the Reaſons aforegoing it might be, that the Prophets laboured ſo much to prove that images were not gods.</p>
                  <p>As the more intelligent Papiſts look upon the images no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as Symbols and Repreſentations of thoſe beings to which they give divine worſhip; ſo the more intelligent Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did no otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>As the wiſer Heathens extremely differed in their opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the gods, from the Vulgar; yet concurred with them in all external rites of worſhip; ſo do the more learned Papiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the ignorant vulgar among them in all external practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their idolatry.</p>
                  <p>To worſhip a falſe God in an image, is double idolatry, becauſe here two things that are not God, are worſhipped with divine worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the ultimate object abſolutely, and the Medium or mediate object, to wit, the image relatively.</p>

Whether it were God or Angels only that appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in humane ſhape, is controvertible; or it might be God the Son as a <hi>preludium</hi> to his incarnation. Beſides, God did not take thoſe humane ſhapes as images or repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of himſelf, but as ſigns of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul of man is Gods image, but in an equivocal, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, metaphorical ſenſe. And ſuch an image of God as it is, it cannot be pictured; and an image of mans body is not ſo much as the image of Gods image.</p>
                  <p>No made image can be the image of that Excellency, in reſpect whereof God differs from the creature.</p>
                  <p>The virtues of the mind are more capable of being pictured, than God is.</p>
                  <p>God forbad the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to make an image of him, and adds this reaſon, That in <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> they ſaw no ſimilitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p>It is folly to ſay, Only ſuch images are forbidden as are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to expreſs the perfect likeneſs of God; and that he hath allowed an image for analogical reſemblance of him. For none is ſo mad as to think any image doth expreſs the perfect likeneſs of God. The Heathens, that acknowledged the Eternal God, did not think that any of their images did expreſs the perfect likeneſs thereof. And did God make a Law to forbid that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the nature of the thing, and allow all poſſible Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of him?</p>
                  <p>The Cherubims were no Repreſentation of God; they were only Hieroglyphical ſigns of Gods own appointment.</p>
                  <p>To make an image of Fire or Light, to ſignifie the inacceſſible light which God dwells in, or to picture rays of light with the Name of God, is not to make an image or repreſentation of him; it is no other than Hieroglyphical writing.</p>

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw that which the Scripture calls Gods back parts, to wit, a created glory.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of difference between imperfect conceptions of God in our minds, and unworthy repreſentations of him to our ſenſes. And I know no other conception of God, than of a Being

                  <p>To make an image to be <hi>medium cultum,</hi> or the thing which we worſhip mediately on pretence of its repreſenting God, and that we worſhip him in it ultimately, is the thing directly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Second Commandment.</p>

                  <p>It is not unlawful to make an image of other things beſides God, as of ſome holy man, as an object or medium of our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exciting our minds to worſhip God.</p>
                  <p>Query, Whether a Crucifix, or an Hiſtorical image of Chriſt, according to his humane body, may not be uſed in that manner? If it be lawful to have ſuch a Picture of Chriſt, why may we not make uſe of the beholding thereof, to excite our devotion to him?</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, ſeeing the Second Commandment forbids the worſhipping of God by a repreſentation, as a means of worſhip, tho not worſhipped; I doubt whether lawfully we may have a Picture of Chriſt (who is worſhipped indeed in his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet only upon the account of his divine nature) as a means of the worſhip rendered to him.

And the ſaid Author ſaith, That to direct our adoration towards a ſupernatural and unimitable tranſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the divine preſence, is not idolatry I ſuppoſe he means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the burning buſh which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw, and the viſible glories on the Mount, were only <hi>media cultus,</hi> not objects thereof, the preſence of God ſhining th ough the ſame as a bright medium.</p>
                  <p>Whether a ſymbolical preſence of God may be erected of mans deviſing, is to be examined. I think it high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>reſumption and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance ſo to do. For it is uncertain, at leaſt to men, whether God in the times of the Goſpel reſide in any local limits more eſpecially than elſewhere. And from our Saviours words <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>Neither in Jeruſalem, nor in this mountain,</hi> &amp;c. the contrary is by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64714:108"/>many ſuppoſed to be evident. But if God doth chuſe any local limits of his ſpecial reſidence more than others, can any beſides himſelf aſſign the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Gods ſpecial reſidence with his people, and yet more ſpecial in the time of his worſhip, is of another reaſon than his reſidence in certain places. And this reſidence with his people he himſelf hath teſtified in his word, and the reaſon of the thing is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to make our Temples or Altars (as ſome call the Communion Tables) to be a <hi>Shechinah</hi> or divine preſence, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is unwarrantable; as alſo to call the Communion Table (as ſome have) <hi>Solium Chriſti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The lifting up of eyes and hands to heaven in prayer and praiſe, is warrantable and comely, becauſe there God dwells in his greateſt viſible glory; and he hath declared in his word, that he hath made the Heaven his throne, and the earth his footſtool.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Churches that worſhipped towards the Eaſt, did not worſhip the Eaſt as a middle term or object, and therefore were not guilty of idolatry. What they meant by it, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not any further, than a myſtical ſenſe in that poſture of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as that Chriſt is the day ſpring from on high, or the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſing, &amp;c. And as to the expediency of that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, I leave it here undetermined.</p>
                  <p>I believe that thoſe among us who bow towards the Altar (as they call it) do not make it an object of worſhip. Some give this account thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, that it is of the ſame nature with putting off our hats while we are there; which putting off the hat ſurely is no making of the Altar, or place where it ſtands, or the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any part thereof, the object of worſhip, but is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reverence either in the worſhip of God, or to the ſtated place of his worſhip. Some may make the Altar a ſymbolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or the throne of Chriſt, which I think to be unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and therefore bowing towards it upon that account to be culpable. Some may have only a myſtical ſignification in it, as was in the ancient uſage of worſhipping towards the Eaſt. Some may uſe it only for uniformity's ſake, that ſeeing to bow to God in their entrance into the Church, and going out of it, is fit (as they ſuppoſe), therefore it is alſo fit to direct it the ſame way. But the expedience of this practice I leave undetermined.</p>

                  <p>Query about incurvation towards the Altar, or Communion-Table, Whether it give not an appearance of idolatry before the Vulgar, and thoſe that are leſs accurate in diſtinguiſhing between an object to which, and toward which?</p>

                  <p>Query much more about directing worſhip towards a Crucifix or other pictures, tho but as to objects of remembrance.</p>
                  <p>The ſame appearance may be in the mixing of expreſſions of veneration to Saints or Angels amidſt the worſhip of God, tho they be not thoſe expreſſions that are appropriated to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but only ſuch as are common to the worſhip due to God and the creatures. There may be indeed a notorious ſignifying of the difference of our veneration towards them, from what is due to God. Howbeit for fear of ſcandal, it may be better wholly forborn.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the like appearance may be in bowing to a King or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate amidſt the Worſhip of God, except time, cuſtom, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing, do notoriouſly notifie the diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Alſo when that which is a common expreſſion both of Civil and Religious honour, ſhall be made by a King to be a ſymbol of giving divinee honour to him, if one uſe that expreſſion towards him or his image with a civil intent, without proteſting againſt the idolatrous uſe thereof.</p>

                  <p>THE meaning of this Queſtion is, Whether all Idolatry be mortal ſin, not only in reſpect of deſert, but exiſtence, as ſins whoſe ordinary habitual practice denies the being of grace, and preſence of the ſanctifying Spirit.</p>
                  <p>That all idolatry in whatſoever degree, is not of this nature, is plain. For idolatry in general is the giving of that honour to the creature, which is due to the Creator alone; and this lies not only in ſolemn avowed worſhip, but in the affection of the heart. There are <hi>Idola ſeculi,</hi> as well as <hi>Idola templi.</hi> And it is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the true worſhippers of God, to rob him of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to place it upon the creature, and that habitually, as on a Child, or Wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho only in a mortified, and not in a prevalent degree. The remainders of covetouſneſs, which is idolatry, is a witneſs hereof.</p>
                  <p>And if this may be in reference to the idols of the heart, why not alſo in reference to the idols of the Templ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>? Nay, more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may it be in this later, than in the former reſpect, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout perſons that live in darker times and places, becauſe it may
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64714:109"/>proceed not from the love of the creature, more than God; but meerly from ignorance and error about the way of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I doubt not, but many holy Souls in darker Ages &amp; Countries, have been habitually or cuſtomarily guilty of a lower kind of Idolatry in making Idols to themſelves, not ſimply as God, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Some kind of Religious Obſervances are unlawful in themſelves, or in the nature of the things, as being naturally unfit to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rd to the Holy God, namely, ſuch kind of Worſhip as was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and other like heathen gods, who were ſerved <hi>congruenti vitio.</hi> And ſuch need not to be forbidden <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are naught in their common nature, being vices, and 'tis enough to be forbidden <hi>in genere.</hi>

                  <head>§ 3. <hi>Of the Rule that limits the kinds of Worſhip.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OF Natural Worſhip, the Law of Nature is the limiting Rule for all the kinds thereof. Of poſitive Worſhip, namely, all that which <hi>in ſpecie</hi> is not neceſſary in nature, but is of free Determination, the kinds thereof are ſuppoſed to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtrained to Divine Inſtitution, or left to humane choice.</p>
                  <p>That there are Divine Inſtitutions of poſitive Worſhip in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kinds, is acknowledged by all that acknowledg the Scriptures Divine Authority. And that many kinds of poſitive Worſhip
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64714:110"/>have been taken up by humane diſcretion, is known by all that know what is practiced in the World. Now the Queſtion is, Whether theſe kinds that are of humane choice, are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or lawfully intermingled in their uſe with Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                  <p>That all kinds of poſitive Worſhip ſhould be left to humane choice, ſeems in reaſon repugnant, in regard of mans natural darkneſs in Divine things, and proneneſs at the beſt to miſtake therein, and to deviſe and chuſe that which is incongruous or leſs congruous; much more in regard of mans propenſity to Superſtition, and bold preſumption about Religious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>de facto,</hi> we find that God hath not ſo left the matter, but taken care to appoint the Worſhip which he expects from men in all Ages, as beſt knowing what is beſt pleaſing to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And in reaſon it muſt needs be, that he hath ſufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his honour in the Worſhip that he hath Inſtituted, as much as concerns or belongs to the reaſon and end of thoſe kinds which he hath inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon it is found in reaſon to be a preſuming of our own againſt the Divine Wiſdom, either to change an Ordinance which God hath inſtituted, for another ordinance of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, of the ſame reaſon, and to the ſame intent; or to add to the Divine Ordinances by way of ſupplement, Humane Ordinances of the ſame reaſon and intent with the Divine; and that either as neceſſary to Divine Service, or only as profitable, and <hi>de bene eſſe.</hi> For ſo to do, is plainly to derogate from the Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it muſt be concluded, that there are certain Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Divine Worſhip which may not be left to mans diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to change them, or to make additions to them of others of the ſame reaſon and intent, either as neceſſary or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; and in that regard ſupplemental and perfective.</p>
                  <p>The expreſs Text of Scripture proves this, that ſome additions are forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. The prohibition is not meerly of adding to the Rule, but of doing more than the Rule requires; as the precept is not of preſerving the Rule, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what is commanded in it. It is indeed againſt mingling the heatheniſh obſervations with Divine Inſtitutions. And it
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64714:111"/>is not to be imagined, that it is only a prohibition of the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Divine Oracles.</p>

                  <p>THE things ſet down under the former head as forbidden, are ſuch new ordinances of Worſhip as are co-ordinate with the divine ordinances, and are in proper ſenſe additions, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in themſelves expreſſing the ſame nature, reaſon, end and uſe, that the divine ordinances have, and conſequently importing an inſufficiency in them.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſuch inſtitutions of men in ſubordination to the divine inſtitutions, as ſerve for the more convenient modifying
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64714:112"/>and ordering of the ſame. And they are not proper Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they are not of the ſame nature and uſe, and theſe are unlawful.</p>
                  <p>All ſuch modes of a duty as are neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and not determined <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> (as when there muſt be a practice one way or other, but whether this way or that way, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of God) are left free to humane determination.</p>
                  <p>This humane determination muſt be regulated by the general Rules of Gods word; of which there be theſe two chief; firſt, That all determinations be made for edification, and not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 2ly. That all things be done decently and in order. Theſe two Rules we find expreſly in Scripture, and they are alſo of the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are neither the eſſential nor integral parts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip; but if any of them be called parts thereof, as being direct expreſſions of honour to God, they are but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental parts; as the putting off the Hat in Divine Worſhip is a Worſhipping of God ſo far as it is an expreſſion of honour to God.</p>
                  <p>And as to ſuch matters, the term of accidental Worſhip may be allowed, not as if they had nothing of the Nature of Worſhip in them in any degree, (for Divine Worſhip is a genus, not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, but Analogical, being predicated of all that comes under it, in ſome common notion or nature, but not in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and theſe partake of the nature of Worſhip, but in the loweſt degree), but becauſe they are not eſſential parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor integral; being contradiſtinct to the ſubſtantial and more important parts thereof. And as being circumſtantial expreſſions of giving honour to God, they may be called cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Worſhip As for example, putting off the Hat is a Worſhip-geſture, and Worſhip only ſo much as geſture comes to.</p>
                  <p>Theſe accidental parts ordinarily go not alone, but in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on other more important parts, even of external Worſhip. Yet it may be here conſidered, whether putting off the Hat, or Bowing, or Kneeling, and the like, may not be Acts of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip <hi>per ſe,</hi> or going alone, and not meerly in concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with other external Acts therof. As, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> his putting off his Shooes in the place where the Buſh burned, were an Act of Worſhip <hi>per ſe,</hi> and not only as a circumſtance or
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64714:112"/>attendance on other Worſhip; and ſo for the ſame or like Act in any other ſymbolical preſence of God. If it be ſo, theſe Acts are even then but of the lower nature of accidental parts or modes of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I conceive the Lords commanding <hi>Moſes</hi> to put off his Shooes, was not a new precept of Worſhip, but only a directing him to, or minding him of that, which already in that caſe was required, by telling him the occaſion, which he was not aware of.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever Nature or Cuſtom hath ſo made decent or reverent, that the negation of it is undecent or irreverent, is doubtleſs commanded of God in his Worſhip, tho not by any particular, yet by general Laws.</p>
                  <p>And the Inſtitution and Obſervation of ſuch things is no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Gods Law, but meerly an Application of the general Law in particular Caſes, as the Law it ſelf doth warrant.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are ſuch mutable things, as are not fit to be in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the matter of an univerſal Law, becauſe they are fit in one place, and at one time, and not another.</p>
                  <p>Note, that things not determined of God, and left to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of men, muſt be ſuch as are neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and not things idle and ſuperfluous. A Superior may not inſtitute a ſuperfluous thing that is not ſimply evil; tho ſometimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior may lawfully obey therein; or to ſpeak more properly, lawfully do the thing to avoid inconvenience, or to teſtifie reſpect to the Superior, tho in that particular he hath no lawful power to command.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that of things neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> the Superior may not lawfully determine for ſuch ſpecies, as, tho not ſimply evil, may have a tendency to evil, or be evil in the conſequence, when he may determine that which will not be evil in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: Yet the inferior may obey, or rather obſerve the thing commanded, when the evil conſequence of non-obſervance will be greater than the evil conſequence of obſervance.</p>

                  <head>§ 6. <hi>Of the lawfulneſs of ſignificant Ceremonies in Divine Worſhip.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BY a Ceremony, I underſtand an external rite in or about the Worſhip of God. By ſignificant Ceremonies, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand rites in Divine Worſhip, ſignifying ſome material point of Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:64714:113"/>
                  <p>There is no controverſie about thoſe outward actions, that by nature or general cuſtome ſignifie the reverence of the mind, as kneeling, and lifting up our Eyes and Hands to Heaven in token of Devotion to the God of Heaven, and being uncovered in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the queſtion is of thoſe that ſignifie meerly by the force of authoritative inſtitution, or private arbitrary intention. Such ſignificant things, tho they may have ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural aptitude to ſignifie ſuch and ſuch points of Religion; yet they do not actually ſignifie, but as arbitrarily deſigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>It is generally received, that ſignificant Ceremonies in taking an Oath may lawfully be uſed; and that not only ſuch as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſignifie, as lifting up the hand towards Heaven, but ſuch alſo as ſignifie by Inſtitution, as laying the hand on a Book, or kiſſing the Book. Now tho the end of an Oath may be a Civil thing, as the ending? of a controverſie; yet the <hi>formale</hi> of it is Divine Worſhip. And the aforeſaid ceremonies are expreſſive of the very external part of it; and they actually ſignifie by force of Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Words ſignifie by general cuſtom, and have the ſame ſenſe out of the Worſhip of God, as in it; and therefore the arguing from their lawfulneſs, as ſigns of Worſhip, unto the lawfulneſs of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ſigns, ſeems liable to exception. Nevertheleſs it may be ſaid, that iniſttuted ſigns ſoon become cuſtomary, and as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as words.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians heretofore being among Infidels, might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have the figure of the Croſs ſomewhere viſible about them, to ſhew that they were Chriſtians. For the meaning was no more than if they had ſaid, We are Chriſtians. But it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, this was no Act of Divine Worſhip, but an indicant or ſpeaking ſign towards men.</p>
                  <p>With acknowledgment of my own weakneſs, I expreſs my app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eheſions of this matter. God hath allowed words for ſigns expreſſive of Divine Worſhip; but I find not that he hath allowed words only, and forbidden Geſtures and Actions for ſuch an end. The dumb muſt expreſs their internal Worſhip by geſtures and actions, or they cannot externally Worſhip God at all. If ſigns of Devotion that are of cuſtomary ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be lawful, I ſee not why ſuch as are of inſtituted ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be unlawful, and eſpecially when they become as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64714:113"/>cuſtomary, as thoſe that have been without inſtitution. And if inſtituted ſigns of devotion in general be lawful, I ſee not why ſigns of ſome ſpecial part of devotion, or myſtery in Religion, ſhould be unlawful.</p>
                  <p>I am more confident of the warrantableneſs of Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Worſhip that are uſed only inſtead of ſo many words pronounced, than of thoſe that are added to words for their more ſolemn ratification, as ſeals are to a writing, or foederal ſigns to a verbal Contract. Nevertheleſs, the forementioned Ceremonies of Swearing ſeem added to the words of the Oath, for more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ratification; and it alters not the caſe whether the words be read by him that adminiſters, or pronounced by him that takes the oath; for either way they are his words that takes the oath.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe I have more confidence of the warrantableneſs of thoſe ſignificant Ceremonies that are of private arbitrary intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than of thoſe that are of authoritative inſtitution; alſo of thoſe that are uſed occaſionally, and <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> than of thoſe that are uſed ſtatedly.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore I apprehend, that ſignificant Ceremonies of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, are more apt to degenerate into Superſtition; and if they be multiplied, that Religion is therewith loaded as with unprofitable luggage; and that it is a form of Religion rather <hi>Moſaical</hi> than Evangelical, wherein ſpiritual worſhip is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p>I think alſo, that ſignificant Ceremonies are not neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> as thoſe things are which are left to the determination of humane authority, and ſo not to be inſtituted and impoſed in the ordinary Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend, that our Lord Chriſt hath inſtituted all thoſe ſtated Ordinances of poſitive Worſhip, that are neceſſary to the Church Univerſal; and therefore that more of the ſame nature are not to be deviſed by men.</p>
                  <p>If any ſignificant Ceremonies be indeed neceſſary for ſome parts of the Catholick Church, in reſpect of time and place, there ſeems to me a fairer plea for their inſtitution in thoſe times and places; but the controverted Ceremonies among us ſeem to be neceſſary for the whole Church in every age, if at all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:64714:114"/>
                  <p>Significant Ceremonies of the ſame nature and reaſon with thoſe perpetual Ordinances that Chriſt hath inſtituted for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church, may not be inſtituted by man, and particularly ſuch as are made Symbols of the Covenant of Grace, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
                  <p>In matters doubted among ſober Chriſtians, Superiors ſhould take heed of ſtrict impoſing, and thereby wreſting the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their ſubjects, and overſtraining them to a compliance with them, in derogation to Gods authority in their conſciences.</p>
                  <p>If Superiors command that which is above their ſphere to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, namely, things not neceſſary <hi>in genere;</hi> yet if they be not ſimply evil, ſubjects may do thoſe things, unleſs they be evil in their conſequence to a higher degree than the not doing of them would be In this caſe it is not formal obedience, but they are done for the ends ſake, and to avoid evil.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is rationally ſuppoſed, that in this act, not the Name, but the Perſon ſo named, is made the object of adoration; the Name pronounced is only the occaſion of the preſent adoration of the Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in Reaſon or Scripture doth evince, that it is ſimply evil to adore Chriſt by incurvation of the body, or other rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent geſture, upon occaſion of the pronouncing of the Name JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, to make ſuch incurvation a ſtated Ordinance of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, may be an exceſs in Religion, that is Superſtition (tho not intolerable) partly, becauſe it too rigidly tyes up Chriſtians to a bodily exerciſe of no neceſſity, nor of great moment; partly, becauſe it makes them attend to an overcurious geſticulation, and verges to externalneſs and formality, hindring the inward life and power of devotion; partly, becauſe it makes a difference where God hath made none; and puts greater honour upon one Name, that of right hath not greater honour than the other, <hi>viz. Chriſt, God, Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah.</hi> For tho the Name be not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worſhipped, yet it hath an honour and preheminence given it above the other names, without ſufficient ground.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſaid incurvation be ſo ſeverely commanded, that great miſchief would follow the non-obſervance, I judg it may
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64714:114"/>be done, tho not formally, in obedience, yet for avoiding that miſchief; and peradventure it may be expedient in that caſe to bow at the name of <hi>Chriſt, God, Lord.</hi>

                  <p>AS for kneeling in the Sacrament, the inquiry is not here of the expediency of it, much leſs of the impoſing of it, but of the bare lawfulneſs of it, againſt which I find no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>The Act of kneeling among us is no adoration of the elements, nor owning of Chriſts corporal preſence; but it is either a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of prayer then made, or a ſign of moſt ſubmiſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential receiving thoſe pledges of Divine Grace, or both.</p>
                  <p>Yet for as much as it was a Table-geſture in which Chriſts Diſciples received it from their Lords hand, a Table-geſture cannot reaſonably be thought leſs ſafe, or leſs decent.</p>

                  <p>AS touching the Surplice, the wearing of a Garment of this or that colour, or of this or that form or ſhape in Divine Worſhip, is neither commanded nor forbidden of God. But tho as to its <hi>materiale</hi> it may be indifferent, yet as to its formal ſtate, it may not be alſo ſo.</p>
                  <p>If the Scurplice be made a holy Garment, as the Prieſtly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the Law; if it be uſed to make him that wears it more holy, and the Service more acceptable for obtaining Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, it is Superſtitious. If it be made a Symbol of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, it may raiſe a ſcruple. But a diſtinctive habit of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, whether uſed as his ordinary garb, or only in ſacred Adminiſtrations, I cannot ſee to be Superſtitious or forbidden. But a habit that is not Superſtitious, may be too gawdy, or too theatrical.</p>
                  <p>What is the formal ſtate or reaſon of the Surplice, is to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the authoritatively declared meaning of thoſe that injoyn it, touching its end and uſe.</p>

                  <p>But whatſoever the nature and reaſon of this Garment be, I cannot approve the inforcing of it upon ſuch Miniſters, and in ſuch Congregations, to whom by reaſon of invincible prejudice, it is either odious or ridiculous, yea tho their prejudice be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed culpable. Wiſe Rulers give way to the unmoveable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of Inferiors in things unneceſſary, and of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho of good intention. And as I ſhould be loth to wear a fools coat in Divine Service upon the command of a Superior, ſo I ſhould be loth to appear in a Congregation in a habit which I knew would be to them as ridiculous as a fools coat, tho it were their great folly ſo to think.</p>

Others of them ſay, they dare not reprove the Ancient Chriſtians that uſed the ſign of the Croſs meerly as a profeſſing ſignal action to ſhew to the Heathen that they did believe in Chriſt crucified. Indeed that uſage thereof was not an Act of Worſhip, but an informing of men touching their faith.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems lawful to ſignifie, as by words ſo by other ſigns, that we are Chriſt's, and his devoted Servants. For Words are but a kind of ſigns.</p>
                  <p>The grounds of ſcrupling the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, are theſe: 1. That it is not a meer circumſtance, but an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Worſhip, as important as an external rite can be. 2. That being a ſolemn and ſtated Symbolical ſign of a Divine Myſtery, and deviſed of men, it is of that claſſis or rank of things which are not neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and ſo not allowed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and impoſed by men, as things neceſſary <hi>in genere</hi> are allowed. 3. That either the whole nature of a Sacrament, or at leaſt a part thereof, is in it.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:64714:115"/>
                  <p>That it is a Sacrament, is thus proved It is an outward and viſible ſign of inward and ſpiritual Grace. The outward ſign is the repreſentation of the Croſs, the inſtrument of Chriſts ſufferings; and the inward ſpiritual Grace is fortitude in the Chriſtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, according to the words of the Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>Here is a ſignification of Grace to be given us of God, and of our duty according to that Grace. Likewiſe this ſign hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned unto it the moral efficacy of a Sacrament for working Grace, by teaching and exciting us to the ſpiritual warfare, and minding us of Chriſt crucified. Alſo it ſignifies and ſeals our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt, or the Grace of being a Chriſtian. And the Liturgy ſo ſpeaks, <hi>We receive this Child into the Congregation of Chriſts Flock, and ſign him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in token,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The pretence, that no rite can be a Sacrament, but what God hath inſtituted, is anſwered before, Sect. 4. And tho the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers thereof, ſay it is not a Sacrament; yet if they ſo declare its meaning, as to be of the formal nature and reaſon of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they make it to be one indeed, tho in word they deny it.</p>
                  <p>If it were granted that it hath not the compleat or intire na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sacrament, yet there is one eſſential part of a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For we uſe it as a token of ingaging our ſelves to Chriſt crucified, as our Captain and Saviour, by his Croſs; and to perform the duties of his Soldiers and Servants to our lives ends. And as Baptiſm dedicates to Chriſt, ſo doth the ſign of the Croſs, according to the expreſs words of the Canon, <hi>viz. It is an honourable badg, whereby the party Baptized is dedicated to the Service of him that dyed on the Croſs.</hi> So it hath that in it which is eſſential to a Sacrament, and part of the nature thereof at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it ſeems to be an Ordinance of that nature and kind, which Chriſt our Lawgiver hath reſerved to himſelf from the reaſon in Sections 3, 4, 5.</p>

                  <p>I ſee no reaſon why it is not lawful for a Nation or People to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an Anniverſary Commemoration of ſome eminent perſon ſent of God as a great light among them, as the firſt propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Goſpel, or great Reſtorer of true Religion among them; as of <hi>Luther</hi> among the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> among the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>R B.</hi> ſaith, That an Apoſtolical Miniſtry being ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a mercy, he can ſee no reaſon why the Churches of all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages may not keep an Anniverſary day for <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. but he ſaith alſo, that whether it be lawful to ſeparate an Anniverſary for the commemoration of Chriſts Nativity, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and ſuch like things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were equally exiſtent in the Apoſtles days, and the reaſons for obſerving them then, equal with the following times, is hard for him to determine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to prove it lawful, and yet not ſeeing a plain prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Yet he gives theſe reaſons of doubting their lawfulneſs. Firſt, the occaſions of theſe days were exiſtent in the Apoſtles times; and if God would have had theſe days obſerved, he could as eaſily and fitly have done it by his Apoſtles in the Scripture, as he did other like things. 2. If it were neceſſary, it would be equally neceſſary in all Ages and parts of the Catholick church, and therefore muſt be the matter of an univerſal Law; and God hath made no ſuch Law in Scripture; and therefore to ſay it is neceſſary, is to overthrow the ſufficiency of Scripture, as the Catholick Rule of Faith, and Univerſal Divine obedience. 3. God himſelf hath appointed a day for the ſame purpoſes as theſe are pretended for; the Reſurrection implies all the reſt of the Works of the Redeemer. 4. The Fourth Commandment being one of the Decalogue, ſeems to be of ſo high a nature, that man is not to preſume to make the like.</p>
                  <p>He accounts it plainly unlawful for any Earthly Power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Weekly day in commemoration of any part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and ſo make another ſtated Weekly Holy-day, becauſe it is the doing of the ſame thing for one day, which God hath done by another; and ſo ſeems an uſurpation of power not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and an accuſation of Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, as if he had not done his Work ſufficiently.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:64714:116"/>
                  <p>I think it alſo an uſurpation of Power not given for any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority, to make any day or time permanently and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably holy, as a perpetual oblation to God, and not only ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the duties therein performed, but alſo ſanctifying the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and making them the more acceptable.</p>
                  <p>But as to the obſervation, much more to the impoſing of the obſervation of Holy-days of human inſtitution, regard is to be had not only to what is lawful, but alſo to what is expedient. And it is as eaſie to offend by exceſs, as by defect, in the inſtituting of ſet-times and days appropriated to Divine Worſhip.</p>

                  <p>Humiliation or Proſtration of ſoul in ſelf abaſement before God, is an act of internal Worſhip.

                  <p>Vows of the aforeſaid allowable Auſterities, to be continued in for term of life, or notable length of time, are dangerous, and apt to inſnare the Conſciences; and if a ſpecial religious ſtate be placed in them, more than what belongs to Chriſtianity as ſuch, they are Superſtition and Will-worſhip.</p>

            <head>MATRIMONIAL P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RITY.</head>
            <p>§ 1. MArriage is the Bond of an individual Conjunction between Man and Woman, inſtituted of God to an individual Converſation or Courſe of Life. This Bond cannot be diſſolved by man, becauſe it is not man but God that makes it, tho the Married parties voluntarily enter into it, and publick Officers inſtrumentally authorize their Act according to Gods Law. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Whom God hath joyned, let no man put aſunder.</hi> But this Rule puts no bar to Gods right of diſſolving this Bond by an Act of his Law upon cauſes therein declared.</p>
            <p>§ 1. By the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Matrimony is held a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this ground, That God hath conſecrated it to be a Symbol of the indiſſoluble Conjunction of Chriſt with the Church, and of Grace to be conferred upon thoſe that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Indeed it is uſed in Scripture as a ſimilitude to expreſs or illuſtrate the Myſtical Union betwixt Chriſt and his Church: But every ſimilitude uſed in Scripture to expreſs a holy Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as that of the Vine and Branches, to expreſs the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the faithful), doth not thereby become a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Symbol thereof, with a promiſe of Grace annexed to it, as ſo conſecrated. Nevertheleſs, tho Matrimony be not an inſtituted Symbol of Divine Grace, yet Grace ſuitable to this ſtate of Life is promiſed to the faithful; and this ſtate (as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe holy ends which God hath deſigned in it.</p>
            <p>§ 3. The Cauſes for which Matrimony was ordained, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſet by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in theſe words. Firſt, It
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64714:118"/>was ordained for the Procreation of Children, to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praiſe of his holy Name. Secondly, it was ordained for a remedy againſt ſin, and to avoid Fornication, that ſuch as have not the gift of continency might Marry and keep themſelves undefiled Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Body. Thirdly, It was ordained for the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society, help and comfort, that the one ought to have of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in proſperity and adverſity.</p>
            <p>It belongs to the ſubſtance of Matrimony, that the Man and the Woman give and take the power of their bodies mutually unto the conjugal due, called benevolence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3, 4. And they are ſo equal in the matter of Wedlock, that both of them are both ſuperior and inferior in asking and rendering the ſaid due. Hence it is a reſolved caſe, That ſterillity is not an impediment of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; becauſe, tho the primary end, which is Procreation, be thereby hindred; yet the ſecondary end, to be a remedy againſt ſin, which is alſo of Gods ordaining, is obtained: But Frigidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or total Impotency, is a juſt impediment, becauſe in that caſe both the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>ſecondary</hi> end of Marriage is made void, and the eſſential due thereof cannot be rendered.</p>
            <p>§ 4. As concerning the ancient Polygamy, or plurality of Wives at once, ſome conceive that it was only by Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, and that it was a ſinful practice, which God winked at. Others conceive that it was by Divine diſpenſation, and that the law of the Conjunction of one Man, and one Woman, was moſt conſentaneous to nature; but that it was not in nature immutable and indiſpenſable, but ſuch as might be changed, the ſtate of things and perſons being changed; yet then not to be changed but by his authority from whom all the Laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do proceed. But whether <hi>Polygamy</hi> were allowed, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly winked at, it appears to be wholly diſallowed by the Law of Chriſt, and was never as yet admitted in any Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. If according to the words of Chriſt, a Man put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away his Wife, and Marrying another, commiteth Adultery; much more doth he commit Adutery, if keeping the former Wife he Marry another.</p>
            <p>The Concubines mentioned in the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> were not, as in our days, unmarried, but properly Wives, tho in reſpect of ſome Matrimonial Priviledges inferior to Wives, ſtrictly ſo
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64714:118"/>called. For their carnal Conjunction with any beſides him, whoſe they were, was a defiling of the Marriage-bed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Reuben,</hi> who lay with <hi>Bilhah, Jacobs</hi> Concubine, this is denounced, <hi>Thou ſhalt not excel, becauſe thou wenteſt up to thy Fathers bed, then defiledſt thou it,</hi> Gen. 49.4.</p>
            <p>§ 5. As concerning the honour of Matrimony, it is written, Heb. 13.4. <hi>Marriage is honourable among all men, and the bed undefiled; but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judg.</hi> This is the law of Chriſt. On the contrary, the hypocriſie, and the countefeit ſanctity of thoſe lyars, who were to bring in the great Apoſtacy upon the Chriſtian Church, is foretold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, among other things, in forbidding to Marry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. And the prohibition of it to divers orders of men, and other unjuſt reſtrictions laid upon it, are one kind of the forbidding to Marry, intended in that prediction.</p>
            <p>The wiſeſt and moſt civilized Commonwealths, that were not Chriſtians, have teſtified their great reſpect to Marriage, by encouraging it with many Priviledges, as more conducing to the publick good, than the ſingle Life. By the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, in times of Gentiliſm, Marriage was priviledged, and the ſingle Life diſadvantaged.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The debaſing of Matrimony, came in with the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Church. Quickly after the Apoſtles age, Chriſtians departed from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, by deviſing rules of Life which Chriſt required not; and built upon the precious foundation, which had been laid, Wood, Hay, and Stubble. And the Devotion both of men and women was carried forth to a ſelf-deviſed religiouſneſs, yet the eſſentials of Chriſtianity were preſerved ſound.</p>
            <p>Accordingly many of the Fathers of the Church extolled Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libate and Virginity with exceſſive praiſes; and thought of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as of a ſtate leſs perfect; and ſome of them, as <hi>Jerome,</hi> were almoſt contumelious againſt it. Yet in thoſe times ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to give ſome check to thoſe contumelies caſt upon Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtianity obtained the Empire, thoſe Laws which were made in ſpecial favour of Marriage, and diſadvantage of ſingle Life, were abrogated; and the Monaſtick ſtate was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64714:119"/>propagated and priviledged. Yea, in later times Married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were encouraged to forſake their yokefellows, and go into Monaſteries.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Upon this occaſion, I am led to conſider, what worth or excellence in celebate and virginity, more than in the Married Life, can be ſhewed from the Holy Scripture, or from right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>In the Scripture we find no greater excellence aſcribed to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle continence, than to Matrimonial chaſtity. It is ſaid, 1 Cor. 7.1. <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a Woman.</hi> The goodneſs here ſpoken of, is a moral convenience; and in that reſpect to abſtain from Marriage is here ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or vertuous. For it is vertuous to chooſe that which is moſt commodious to Chriſtian life, and to avoid all avoidable hinderances of the freer exerciſe of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now divers cares and troubles which accompany Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, may well be avoided by one who hath the ſpecial gift of continence. And thoſe difficulties and ſufferings which come upon us in times of the Churches calamities, may be better born, and the temptations thereof more eaſily eſcaped in a ſingle, than in a Married Life.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26. Virginity is commended, not from its intrinſick excellency (as far as that appears), but from its conveniency, in regard of the diſtreſſes of the Church. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is good for the preſent diſtreſs.</hi> Here alſo he uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſhews, that the thing is vertuouſly good; but upon what account? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It had in that ſtate of things a Moral convenience, and therefore to make choice of it was vertuous. Yet he ſhews, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. that to Marry in ſuch a time, is no ſin, tho not to Marry be more expedient. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32, 33, 34. and ſo to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſingle Life is prefered before Marriage, by reaſon of its convenience, and on no other account.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Marriage was inſtituted for man in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And it muſt needs be acknowleeged by all, that in that ſtate it would have been altogether as pure and perfect as Celibate and Virginity. If Matrimony, by reaſon of the fall be accompanied with ſome unavoidable irregularities, or inordinate motions
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64714:119"/>in the ſenſitive Nature, ſingle life is a like, yea perhaps more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>Matrimonial chaſtity is as truly chaſtity, as Virginal chaſtity. And the ſame degree of Matrimonial chaſtity is equally pure, with the ſame degree of Virginal chaſtity; or to ſpeak in other terms, there may be as great chaſtity both of body and mind in Matrimony, as in Virginity.</p>
            <p>If there be a glory and excellency in that Victory over ſenſe, which they have, who having the gift of continence, abſtain from the ſenſitive pleaſure of the Marriage-bed; it may be equalled by the ſobriety and regularity of the uſe of the Marriage bed, being accompanied with a Chriſtian Wiſdom, Fortitude, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in bearing and managing the difficulties of the Married condition, for the glory of God, and the good of the Church and Commonwealth, beſides the private good of Families. And there appears much leſs ſelf-denial in a ſingle, than in a married life, to be exerciſed by thoſe that have the gift of continence.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Principles tending to render Marriage vile and loathſome, have been propagated by ſome out of an exceſſive admiration of Virginity, and total abſtinence from carnal conjunction; and by others, whoſe intereſt it was to inhance the reputation of ſingle life, for the ſtrengthning of the Papal Kingdom. Of which ſort are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The natural deſire of copulation is prohibited luſt: That corporeal delight may not be intended in the conjugal act: That a mans deſire of pleaſure with his own Wife cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin: That a man doth ſin, except he come to the act with grief. Accordingly ſome Popiſh Writers have ſaid, That moſt frequently mortal ſin, and always venial ſin, is committed in the conjugal act. And the truth is, if theſe things were true, they were enough to deter from Marriage all thoſe that have a due care of their own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Some of great name among the Ancients held, That there ſhould have been no commixtion of Sexes in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, becauſe tho it were uſed for procreation alone, yet (as they thought) it could not have been without ſhameful luſt.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Now for the redargation of ſuch opinions, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that when men otherwiſe very worthy, ſhall give ſcope to their own conceits, and ſhall advance ſelf-choſen ways, they will
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64714:120"/>overlook the cleareſt evidence both of Scripture and Reaſon. For what other cauſe could be rendered for the creation of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sexes, but the foreſaid commixtion? And of a man and his wife in the ſtate of innocence it was ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> And for the vehement deſire of the ſaid conjunction, it is in it ſelf an Animal Faculty for the conſervation of the Species, as the like deſire of ingeſtion and egeſtion is for the conſervation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual.</p>
            <p>Since the Fall, the ſenſitive appetite ought to be diſtinguiſhed from its inordinacy, from which by grace it may be ſeparated, and ſo it may be alike pure and ſinleſs with other parts of human nature in this imperfect ſtate. And this being granted in other kinds of ſenſitive appetite, why ſhould it be denied in the kind here treated of? Some ſay of it, That it is a brutifying act; and that the mind is ſo carried away therein, that it can think nothing worthy of a wiſe man. But I make no queſtion, but godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons know the contrary by experience. And I can ſee no reaſon, but that they who have crucified the fleſh with its affections and luſts (as all true Chriſtians have) may by due care carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this matter with a due ſobriety and regularity, and that the more perfect Chriſtians ordinarily do ſo. And tho herein they be not perfectly, yet they are prevalently pure. And that it is perfectly pure, can ſcarce be ſaid of any good act in the preſent ſtate of mankind. The delight of eating and drinking after hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, or of reſt after labour, doth ſwallow up Reaſon in the Vicious, or more or leſs diſturb it, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their intemperance. And ſo the delight here conſidered, doth ſwallow up Reaſon in them that uſe it inordinately, and that more or leſs, according to the degree of their inordinacy. But as the delight of eating and drinking doth not brutifie the temperate; ſo the delight here conſidered, doth not brutifie them that uſe it purely and ſoberly, not in oppoſition, but ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpiritual delights.</p>
            <p>§ 11. Indeed it is undeniable, and witneſſed by the common ſenſe of human nature, that ſince the Fall a ſhameful turpitude doth inſeperably adhere to this act. And this is a natural intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to mankind of their vicious propagation in their fallen ſtate (I mean in reſpect of original ſin) and a manifeſt ſign of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon viciouſneſs and brutiſhneſs in this caſe, as alſo of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64714:120"/>of paſſion or ſenſual commotion, to which all are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous herein, and ordinarily more than in other ſenſualities, if it be not carefully brought under the due governnance of reaſon. Wherefore that <hi>Cynical</hi> impudence which ſome are reported to have acted herein, is to be abhorred of all men. And even Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, much more Chriſtian modeſty, requires the greateſt reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs herein. Nevertheleſs, this inſeparably adhering turpitude is not always and directly, or of it ſelf a ſinfulneſs. That there is a natural, where there is not a ſinful turpitude, many inſtances do ſhew. That many things juſt, and honeſt, and neceſſary, have a kind of ſhamefulneſs in them, is acknowledged by men in general. If in the preſent inſtance there be always ſome ſinfulneſs, it is no other than what is found in all the good acts of men in this their imperfect ſtate. And thoſe acts are not counted nor called ſins by reaſon of ſuch adhering ſinfulneſs, for that they are prevalently, tho not perfectly good and virtuous.</p>

When the Diſciples ſaid, If the caſe of a man be ſo with his Wife, it is good not to marry; Our Saviour anſwered, <hi>All men cannot receive this ſaying, ſave they to whom it is given.</hi> And v. 12. <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I would that every man were even as my ſelf; but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, another after that.</hi> And of the unmarried and Widows he ſpeaks, <hi>If they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, let them marry.</hi> This ſhews that all have not that ſingular gift from God to preſerve themſelves in pureneſs of body and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without the remedy of Marriage. And nothing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Scripture or Reaſon to argue that the bare want of the ſaid ſingular gift is a ſinful incontinence. The general <hi>impetus</hi> of nature to the conjunction of Male and Female, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the perpetuating of mankind. And if it were not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally implanted in nature, there is reaſon to think, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the many great intanglements and moleſtations that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Marriage, many would not encumber themſelves therewith, and ſo would refuſe to ſerve the Providence of God, in the ſucceſſive Generations of men upon Earth, in that regular way of Procreation, which he hath appointed for mankind from the beginning.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:64714:121"/>
            <p>And who knows, but in the ſtate of Innocence, as there might be vehement Hunger and Thirſt, ſo there might be an <hi>impetus</hi> of Nature to this conjuction? I ſuppoſe that in the ſtate of innocence, the motions of the ſenſitive appetite would not be raiſed, and laid immediately, at the call of the rational ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; but from the ſenſitive nature it ſelf as the immediate ſource and ſpring from which they iſſue, and to which they return. Yet I firmly hold, that in that ſtate, the ſaid motions were ſo perfectly under the government of the rational appetite, doing its Office, as thereby to be always diverted from whatſoever would be diſhoneſt. But I think, that that good government muſt have been maintained by prudence and diligence; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with trouble and difficulty (as now it is), but with a pleaſant and facile induſtry. In caſe of Hunger and Thirſt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent nature might admit a ſimple motion of ſenſe to Eat and Drink in a time unſeaſonable for ſuch an act; but Reaſon, and the rational appetite, would ſo bridle it, that no irregular act of Mind or Body ſhould follow.</p>
            <p>§ 13. In the want of the gift of continence, legitimate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony is the remedy appointed of God, 1 Cor. 7.1. <hi>It is good for a man not to touch Woman. Nevertheleſs to avoid Fornication, let every Man have his own Wife, and every Woman her own Husband.</hi> The meaning whereof is, Tho in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects it be more convenient to be unmarried; yet there is one reſpect of greater moment, which commands the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi> to avoid Fornication. And verſ. 9. <hi>It is better to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than to burn.</hi> God doth not give to all, to overcome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinacy of carnal deſire, without Marriage, where it may be duly had; and ſuch as cannot otherwiſe overcome the ſaid inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy, muſt Marry if they can, to keep themſelves pure in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, or (as 'tis expreſſed in the Liturgy), <hi>undefiled Members of Chriſts Body.</hi>

To be regulated by thoſe Laws which God hath ſet in Nature and Scripture, is mans uprightneſs; but to depart from them to ſelf-deviſed ways, is his ſin and folly, under a ſhew of Wiſdom; and by pleaſing himſelf therein, he deviates more and more from the right way. The general admiring of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery and Vows of ſingle Life, hath as much contributed to the corruption of the Chriſtian Religion, and the advancing of the Antichriſtian Impurity and Superſtition, as any inſtitution or cuſtom that ever was taken up in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>Howbeit ſome may be called to ſingle Life for Religions ſake, according to the Words of our Saviour, Matt. 19.12. <hi>There he Eunuchs, which have made themſelves Eunuchs for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heavens ſake. He that is able to receive it, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi> Such as clearly know, they have received the gift above mentioned, may be called of God to ſingle Life, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves more freely in ſerving God, either in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private calling. All that are ſo gifted, are not hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called; becauſe many of them may be required to glorifie God, and do good in a Married ſtate, either in reſpect of their own Families, or the Commonwealth. But in regard there be few comparatively, who have received this gift, it is moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſuppoſed, that they who have received it, ſhould make uſe of it (yet not under the conſtraint of a Vow, but freely) for thoſe holy and good e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds which are beſt obtained by it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome ſpecial reaſon, as aforeſaid, doth oblige them to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But let them know, that in uſing their gift, they do no more than what is their duty to do. The diſtinction between Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Precepts in this and other matters, is but vain. For it is the bounden duty of all, to do their utmoſt for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64714:122"/>of God, and their own, and others good.</p>
            <p>§ 16. As ſelf-deviſed religiouſneſs by degrees increaſed among Chriſtians, accordingly many rigorous Prohibitions and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about Marrying, both groundleſs and unreaſonable, were deviſed. Many of the Ancients, both Fathers of the Church, and Hereticks, were averſe to, or at leaſt not much pleaſed with ſecond ſucceſſive Marriages, either in Clergy or Laity. And ſome degree of Penance for the ſame was injoyned by the Canons of ſome Councils.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all,</hi> without exception; thereby ſhewing, that no condition of life puts a bar to it, againſt thoſe who are capable of it. And if no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Life be a bar thereunto, why ſhould former Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages be ſo? The Scripture expreſly aſſerts the lawfulneſs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3. <hi>If a Woman, while her husband lives, be married to another, ſhe ſhall be called an adultereſs: but if her husband be dead, ſhe is free from that law: ſo that ſhe is no adultereſs, tho ſhe be married to another man.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Widows, 2 Cor. 7.9 <hi>If they cannot contain, let them marry.</hi> Verſ. 39. <hi>A Wife is bound by the law, as long as her husband lives: but if her husband he dead, ſhe is at liberty to be married to whom ſhe will, only in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe young Widows, whoſe Marriage is condemned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.11, 12. were ſuch as had devoted themſelves to the ſervice of the Church, according to the manner of thoſe times. And they are ſaid to have Condemnation, not ſimply becauſe they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but becauſe they caſt off their firſt faith, that is, they did violate their engagement to Chriſt, and the Church, to pleaſe the fleſh. Upon this ground the Apoſtle forbids the admitting of younger Women into that ſpecial Miniſtry, that they might not be expoſed to ſuch temptation. And verſ. 14. he exprefly wills, <hi>That the younger women ſhould marry;</hi> which muſt neceſſarily include young Widows alſo; becauſe it is brought in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the condemning of young Widows in caſe of preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication againſt their aforeſaid engagement. His meaning is to ſhew, that it is moſt covenient for them to Marry in regard of their age and condition; yet not to bind any abſolutely ſo to do.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:64714:122"/>
            <p>Some of the Ancients thought the Apoſtle granted ſecond Marriages only <hi>ex Venia,</hi> by way of indulgence or diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that he who uſed it, ſinned not, as being not forbidden by the Law; but he did not fulfil that high perfection of Life that the Goſpel calls unto. But herein ſuch indulged their own opinion; and I find that they were in other things very fanciful, and over-rigorous in their Principles, and ſomewhat Stoical. But the Evangelical Law, or the New Teſtament, hath not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>The prohibiting of ſecond Marriages, tends to the diminution of mankind, and the weakning of Commonwealths, with other inconveniences.</p>
            <p>§ 17. Succeſſive Marriages more often reiterated, had a greater ill name among the Ancients. But thoſe places of Scripture which licenſe Widows to marry, do it indefinitely, without limitation, to a Widow of the firſt Husband only. And we find in Scripture no reſtraint againſt third, fourth, or more Marriages. And according to reaſon, if a Widow of the firſt Husband may lawfully Marry, Why not alſo a Widow of the ſecond Husband, ſeeing there may be the ſame juſtifiable cauſe of Marriage? Indeed there may be an exceſs in the reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of ſucceſſive Marriages; but then the diſhoneſty or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs lies not in the Reiteration of the Marriage in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but in the exceſs, as undecent and uncomely. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable frequency of ſuch Reiteration, is not punctually defined in general, and a like to all; but is varied according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſes of perſons. In the caſe propounded by the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to our Saviour of ſeven Brethren ſucceſſively married to one Woman, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.25. he ſpeaks nothing of the illegitimacy or unſoundneſs of the ſaid Marriages. The caſe of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. is to be conſidered. Our Saviour doth tax her for living at that time with one as a husband, who indeed was not her husband; but he doth not expreſly reprove her former plurality of ſucceſſive Husbands; nor do I obſerve that he puts any note of ſinfulneſs upon it; yet for ought I know, there might be ſinfulneſs in the undecent exceſs thereof.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts ſay, That the Catholick Church allows ſecond and third Marriages, and in whatſoever number ſucceſſively; yet the benediction ought not to be allowed to ſuch Marriages,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64714:123"/>becauſe the Conſecration ought not to be reiterated. But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the benediction, and the ill reflection it hath upon ſecond Marriages, is founded upon an error, that Marriage is a Sacrament, and conſecrated to be a Symol of the Myſtical Union between Chriſt and the Church.</p>
            <p>§ 18. Seeing the gift of Continence in ſingle Life, is the Priviledg of particular perſons, and not of certain Orders and Callings of men, a Vow or other Obligation to ſingle Life, ſhould not be laid upon all that enter into ſome ſpecial Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; but particular perſons ſhould be left free therein to marry, or abſtain from Marriage, as they find themſelves qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and called to the one, or the other.</p>
            <p>That Marriage is lawful and honeſt in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is evident from Scripture, againſt all prejudices ariſing from cuſtoms introduced, or Canons made in after-ages. That one evidence, that among the qualifications of a Biſhop, it is mentioned that he be the Husband of one Wife, is clear and full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all contradiction. As <hi>Peter</hi> had a Wife, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews that he had power to take a Wife, even in his Apoſtleſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 5. <hi>Have we not power to lead about a Siſter, a Wife, as well as the other Apoſtles?</hi> By a Siſter he means a believing Chriſtian; by leading about a Siſter, a Wife, he means living in Matrimony.</p>
            <p>That diſeaſe of our fallen nature, for which Marriage is appointed a remedy, is common to all ſorts; and therefore the remedy ſhould be as common. And, as is before noted, the gift of Continence is a priviledg of particular perſons, and not of certain Orders and Callings.</p>
            <p>Marriage is in it ſelf no more impure to the Clergy, than to the Laity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure.</hi> There is no Eſtate or Calling polluted by Marriage, or made leſs holy, or leſs worthy by the uſe of it; for it is honourable in all men. And it is to be conſidered, that Gods Law binds every Chriſtian to live as chaſtly and purely, as a Prieſt or Miniſter of the Goſpel. And that which doth not leſſen the holineſs of a Chriſtian, doth not leſſen the holineſs of a Miniſter. Indeed Miniſters are more ſtrongly obliged than others to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chaſt in body and mind; becauſe, whereas others are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſingle, they are under a double Obligation therunto, both as they are Chriſtians, and as they are Chriſts Miniſters. But
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64714:123"/>the chaſtity to which they are obliged, is the common duty of all Chriſtians. Only where there is a greater engagement to chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is a greater aggravation of the ſin of uncleanneſs. And it concerns Miniſters more than others, that they break not the Common Laws of Chriſtianity in this regard, becauſe thereby they give a greater ſcandal than others.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Marriage is no more a hinderance to Miniſters, than to all Chriſtians in their acts of devotion. For all are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to exerciſe themſelves unto godlineſs, to pray always, watching thereunto with all perſeverance. And ſuch exerciſes as require abſtinence from conjugal embraces (as extraordinary prayer, with faſting) do alike concern Clergy and Laity. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this evidence of Scripture and Reaſon for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of Marriage in the Clergy, the Policy of Hypocrites, and the Superſtition of honeſt minds, hath ſo far prevailed againſt it, as to make it no better than Inceſt, and worſe than Fornication.</p>
            <p>§ 19 There is no more reaſon to reſtrain the Clergy from ſecond Marriages, than from the firſt. For there is commonly as great reaſon impelling to a ſecond Marriage, as to the firſt. And there is no more impurity or uncomelineſs in the ſecond Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Clergy-men, than in the firſt. The Matrimonial acts of ſecond Marriages, have no more blemiſh nor unſeemlineſs in them, than thoſe of the firſt.</p>
            <p>There is no reaſon to reſtrain the Clergy more than the Laity, from ſecond Marriages. For if it may be ſanctified to the one, it may as well be ſanctified to the other alſo; if it may be neceſſary for the one, it may be alſo as neceſſary for the other. And the Matrimonial acts of ſecond Marriages are no more uncomely in a Clerick, than in a Laick. No reaſon can be given why there ought not to be as great a chaſtity in every Chriſtian, as in a Biſhop. Every Chriſtian is in a true ſenſe a Prieſt to God, and a devoted perſon.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts under the Law were expreſly forbidden to take a Wife that was a Whore, or prophane, or a woman put away from her Husband, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.7. And good reaſon there might be for prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting a Prieſts marriage with a divorced woman, becauſe the Law of Divorce was but of divine ſufferance to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearts, as our Saviour ſaith. The High-Prieſt was expreſly forbidden to marry a Widow, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Some of the ſaid
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64714:124"/>Prohibitions were moſt probably in reference to a ceremonial ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity peculiar to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> diſpenſation. But neither the High Prieſt, nor other Prieſts were forbidden to marry a ſecond Wife upon the death of the firſt.</p>
            <p>I ſee no reaſon to conceive, that by the Text 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. any thing is forbidden in a Biſhop which is lawful in other Chriſtians. By the husband of one Wife the Apoſtle means, one that is not married to two Wives at once, according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Jews</hi> and other Eaſtern Nations; and one that hath not married a ſecond Woman after he hath put away the firſt without lawful cauſe; or that hath not taken one that was unlawfully put away by another, according to the cuſtom of the Weſtern Nations.</p>
            <p>§ 20. The forbidding of the innocent party to marry after a juſt divorce, was another groundleſs and unreaſonable prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now the crime of adultery is the ground of a juſt divorce. Matt. 19.9. <hi>Whoſoever putteth away his Wife, except it be for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and ſhall marry another, committeth adultery.</hi> Here the putting away of a Wife, and the marrying of another, is declared to be the committing of Adultery, except it be for Fornication. This by the moſt unqueſtionable Rule of interpretation ſhews, that if a man put away his Wife for Fornication, and marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he doth not commit adultery. For this is the caſe expreſly excepted from the general propoſition, and therefore exempt from the guilt therein expreſſed; and unleſs ſuch an exemption were thereby ſignified, the exception were in vain. And it is to be further noted, that the excepting of the caſe of Fornication, muſt refer more eſpecially to the later clauſe of marrying another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the bare putting away of a Wife in any caſe, without proceeding further, there is no committing of Adultery. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the marrying of another in the ſaid caſe of exception, that is deſigned to be exempted from the ſaid guilt. Hereupon thoſe general propoſitions about the ſame matter, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. muſt according to a juſt interpretation be limited by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception here expreſſed, which muſt be neceſſarily there under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>Howbeit upon an unjuſt divorce, for the innocent or injured party to marry another, we do not find it lawful. For Chriſt declares, <hi>Mart.</hi> 5 21. <hi>Whoſoever putteth away his Wife, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ving for the cauſe of fornication, cauſeth her to commit adultery: and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64714:124"/>whoſoever marrieth her that is divorced, committeth adultery.</hi> Here he ſeems to reſolve, That he is an Adulterer that marrieth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent party that is put away; and that the firſt contracted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is not diſſolved by the unjuſt divorce; and that the woman unjuſtly put away, ought to ſtay unmarried in hope of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to her husband, until ſuch time as his Adultery in any kind, and in particular in the marrying of another Wife, doth ſet her at liberty.</p>
            <p>§ 21. For the further clearing of the point here diſcuſſed, it is to be noted in what ſenſe the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iage-bond is diſſolved, and in what ſenſe it is not diſſolved by Adultery. Certain it is, that the ſaid bond is not diſſolved <hi>ipſo facto</hi> by the ſaid crime, ſo that the conjugal relation immediately ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſeth, and conjugal familla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thenceforth becomes unlawful. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vertheleſs the bond is ſo far diſſolved, that the offending-party hath forfeited the relation, and all the conſequent Rights thereof, and the injured party is no longer bound to continue the relation, and the conſequent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof if he will take the forfeiture; and ſo the bond is actually diſſolved, and the relation ceaſeth by his will: yet he is bound to proceed in it regularly, and according to publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is ſaid by many, That the allowed divorce doth not ſignifie the breaking of the conjugal bond in the ſubſtance, but a relaxation thereof as to conjugal duties; it to be noted, that the queſtion put to our Saviour by the Phariſees, was about putting away as to the Matrimonial bond. For there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putting away among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor among the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor other Nations among whom Divorce was in uſe. Beſides, to ſpeak of a putting away, and of a being at liberty from bed and board, and all Matrimonial duties, and yet not from the bond of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is but idle talk. The ſtate is diſſolved where all the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conſequent to ſuch a ſtate are abrogated. Moreover the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves allow the diſſolving of a Marriage with ſuch an Infidel as will not cohabit without uſing contumely againſt Chriſt, and ſeeking to turn the yokefellow from Chriſt. And is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, eſpecially if continued, as juſt a cauſe of the diſſolution, ſeeing this cauſe is expreſſed in Gods Law, whereas the other is not? And whereas they ſay there is not the ſame firmneſs in the marriage of Infidels, as of Chriſtians; this they ſpeak without
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64714:125"/>proof, and againſt the Law of God, which hath made Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as inviolable among Infidels, as among Chriſtians. This is a Divine Ordinance belonging not to the Church only, but to all mankind.</p>
            <p>§ 22. As touching the allowableneſs of another Marriage to the innocent party in caſe of a declared wilful deſertion by the other, we find this written, 1 Cor. 7.15. <hi>If the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving depart, let him depart. A brother and ſiſter is not under bondage in ſuch caſes.</hi> It is hence gathered by ſome, that in a Marriage between a believer and an unbeliever, in caſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing party depart out of hatred to true Religion, and if the believing party hath uſed all poſſible and reaſonable means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the other to a due Conjunction, and hath ſtaid a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time for that purpoſe, and cannot prevail therein, he is looſed from this bond. This inference from the Text, ſeems to me highly probable, that I cannot diſallow it. Many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches have determined this, and applied it further to other caſes of obſtinate deſertion, beſides this before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; that the matter being judged by the Magiſtrate, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent party may Marry another. As for the prohibition, Verſ. 11. <hi>If ſhe depart, let her remain unmarried;</hi> therein an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Marriage is forbidden only to ſuch as voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. It is to be noted, that there may be a juſt volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry departing, which is not of the ſame reaſon with a juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</p>
            <p>§ 23. <hi>Abiſhag,</hi> who was ſought for <hi>David,</hi> to cheriſh him in his extream age, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.2. was his Concubine, that is, not his Harlot, but his lawful Wife, in a ſecondary degree, or inferior rank. I mean lawful, only by Gods permiſſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, in regard of his plurality of Wives at once, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtom of the ancient times; yet lawful by Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, in caſe he had had no other Wife then in being. From this example, it is at leaſt probable that it is not a ſin in it ſelf in extream old age to take a Wife as a cheriſhing Nurſe, or a boſom companion. For the declared intent of <hi>Davids</hi> taking <hi>Abiſhag,</hi> was that ſhe might lie in his boſom, and cheriſh him in his age, when he could get no heat. And it is ſaid, <hi>That ſhe cheriſhed him, but he knew her not.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="241" facs="tcp:64714:125"/>
            <p>§ 24. The Bed undefiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. is that which is not defiled with Adultery, Fornication, or any kind of unchaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unſoberneſs. To the maintaining of which undefiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the avoiding of all uncleanneſs, Chriſtians are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged by the purity of their Religion. Here I deſign to ſpeak of uncleanneſs not without, but within the bounds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and to give caution againſt all corrupt behaviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and his own Wife; becauſe men are commonly leaſt aware of this evil; and becauſe this is the Damnation of multitudes, who defile not themſelves with ſtrange embraces; and while they think they live chaſtly, do ſecurely allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in very great breaches of the laws of chaſtity. To keep the Bed undefiled, it is neceſſary to obſerve, not only the due object of Conjunction, or the legitimate perſon; but all due eircumſtances of time, place, meaſure, manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ſenſuality or luſt, is not excuſed by being acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween perſons lawfully married. The honeſty and honour of Matrimony cannot make that to be lawful and honeſt, which is in it ſelf diſhoneſt and ſinful. All manner of luſt or evil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and the imperated acts thereof, are forbidden by the Law.</p>
            <p>§ 25. There be divers ways of abuſing the Marriage-bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and his own Wife, whereof ſome are more foul and groſs than others. There be nefarious irregulaties that ſome fall into by unbridled luſt. There are preternatural ways, by which humane nature cannot be propagated, and which are juſtly to be abhorred by all, who have not loſt the ſenſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Moreover a man may come to his Wife, as to a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, with a ſpirit of Whoredom, and ſeek a brutiſh pleaſure, which extinguiſheth the fear of God. Such exceſs as doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably impair the health of the Body, or vitiate the mind, and make it more carnal, is unqueſtionably to be avoided, and will be avoided by thoſe that are careful to keep a ſound ſtate of body or mind.</p>
            <p>§ 26. It is by all confeſſed, that in two caſes the conjugal embraces are without fault: firſt, when they are for the ſake of Procreation; ſecondly, when the due is rendred to the yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow requiring it. The reaſon of the former is, becauſe then
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64714:126"/>the action is referred to the primary end for which Matrimony was ordained. The reaſon of the later is, becauſe it is an Act of Juſtice; that being rendred to another, which is his right. For herein the married parties have a mutual power over each other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Yet be it always minded, that even in the ſaid caſes, it muſt be regulated by the Rules of Chriſtian Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Some have ſaid, That the uſe of the Marriage-bed, without reſpect to Procreation of Children, is baſe or unclean. And ſome chief Schoolmen have determined, that the uſe thereof, to allay the inordinancy of carnal deſire, or to avoid Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Procreation is not deſigned, is a ſin, tho but a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſin. This requires our animadverſion.</p>
            <p>§ 27. Among the ends of Marriage, this is one, and a principal one, and which renders it neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> To be a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fornication, or againſt burning, that is the inordinacy of carnal deſire, 1 Cor. 7.2. <hi>Nevertheleſs to avoid Fornication, let every man have his own Wife, and every Woman have her own Husband.</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>If they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</hi> Now if this end of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age be ſo momentous, as to make it neceſſary in this caſe; Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the uſe of the Marriage-bed for this end cannot be ſin. That which God hath ordained for the cure of this diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly adhering to fallen nature, cannot be ſin, being uſed to that end, tho the diſeaſe it ſelf, which is the occaſion of it, be not without ſin. Moreover, that cannot be ſin which the Apoſtle directs men to make uſe of to avoid Satans temptations to ſin. But the Apoſtle directs to the uſe of the Marriage bed, as a preventive remedy againſt Satans temptations to incontinency, 2 Cor. 7.5. <hi>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for a time, that you may give your ſelves to faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency.</hi>

            <p>If a mans caſe be ſuch, that without the uſe of Marriage, Fornication, or other bodily uncleanneſs, or inward impurity of deſires and motions, cannot be ordinarily avoided by him; and if in that caſe, it be his duty to marry, then the avoiding of Fornication, or other impurity, corporeal or mental, is one
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64714:126"/>lawful and honeſt end of the uſe of the Marriage-bed, even when there is no power of procreation; and the procreation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is not always neceſſary to be reſpected therein.</p>
            <p>§ 28. When there be ſeveral lawful and neceſſary ends of the uſe of Marriage, <hi>viz</hi> procreation, and the avoiding of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or burning, it is not neceſſary that the later of the ſaid ends ſhould be always conjunct with, and referred to the former; but it may be ſometimes ſeparate and independent thereon. For the ſaid ends are not things ſubordinate, but coordinate; each of them is intended for it ſelf, and the one is not in meer ſubſervien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the other. It is granted, that the former end is more noble, as being neceſſary to Nature in it ſelf conſidered; and the later leſs noble, as being made neceſſary by Nature fallen. Yet it doth not appear from Scripture or right Reaſon, that the uſe of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed is ſinful and impure in the leſs noble, yet neceſſary end thereof, upon the failing of the other, which is the more noble. The truth is, as the ſtate of man is ſince the Fall, there is no end of Marriage of greater moment, than the preſerving of Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the due benevolence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. is one of the eſſential dues of Marriage.</p>
            <p>Let it be here noted, that they who hold the uſe of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed without reſpect to procreation, to be ſin, do hold it no ſin in that caſe to render the due benevolence when required, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a point of juſtice. But if this thing be a ſin on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders part, the rendering of it cannot be a due. It is granted, there may be a ſinful demanding of a juſt debt; and in that caſe the rendering of that which is ſinfully demanded, is a point of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but it is not ſo, if the very thing demanded be the ſin of the demander. For ſin cannot be a matter of right; and there can be no obligation of Juſtice to cooperate to anothers ſin. And therefore if the rendering of this benevolence be a righteouſneſs, the demand thereof is righteous, and the thing demanded is no ſin.</p>
            <p>§ 29. They who reject the aforeſaid end, and condemn the aforeſaid uſe of Marriage, which is clearly juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4, 5 do alledg that which is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>This I ſpeak by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not of commandment.</hi> Wherein they ſay the Apoſtle by way of pardon grants the uſe of luſt within the bounds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64714:127"/>Hereupon the true intent of thoſe words is to be examined. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is uſed both for permiſſion, and for pardon; and here it is evidently uſed for permiſſion, being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> commandment; and it ſignifies not the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a fault, but the allowing of an honeſt liberty, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct to the injoining of duty. The Apoſtle's meaning is, that he doth not injoyn Marriage, or the uſe of the Marriage due, as a general duty (for he wiſhes that all men were as himſelf) but allows it as a lawful benefit. And not only ſo, but he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it as a remedy againſt ſin, for thoſe that have need of it, in which caſe it becomes a duty.</p>
            <p>To ſay that the uſe of luſt is here granted within the bounds of Matrimony, is, I think, an imputation too foul to caſt upon the word of God; and for it to grant by way of pardon the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a leſſer ſin, that ſome greater ſin may be avoided, ſeems to derogate from its perfect purity. Never was any moral evil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Gods Moral Law, upon the reaſon of avoiding a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evil. The permiſſion of Divorce among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, and did of it ſelf amount to no more than a legal impunity in that Commonwealth. For the Divorcing of a Wife might be a mortal ſin notwithſtanding. Mal. 2 16. <hi>The Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſaith, that he hateth putting away.</hi> Moreover if the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt needs ſignifie Pardon, let them who will have it ſo, ſhew cauſe why it muſt not be applied as well to the rendering, as to the demanding of the conjugal due For whatſoever the ſenſe of the word be, neither the expreſs Text, nor rational interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth carry it to one part, excluding the other. But them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deny that the rendering of the due doth need pardon.</p>
            <p>§ 13. It is common with thoſe who are looſe in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, to be very ſevere in the Traditions of men; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this kind of principle Popiſh Writers hold, that the intendment of corporeal delight in the uſe of Marriage, is a ſin; and that it is not without fault if it be done partly for procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and partly for pleaſure, tho the pleaſure be not chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. What ſtrange rigor is here impoſed upon mankind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt human nature it ſelf, to make it ſin for a man to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deſire of pleaſure in the fruition of his own Wife? If ſenſitive pleaſure be naturally connex with the innate appetite, the intended fruition thereof can be no more ſin, than Nature
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64714:127"/>it ſelf. Yea, let theſe rigid Impoſers think, whether the non-frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or non-intendment of that which is inſeparable from ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nature, be naturally poſſible, and conſequently whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this principle, the procreation which they allow, muſt not neceſſarily be accounted ſin. Theſe and the like opinions greatly detract from the purity and honour of Marriage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly leſſen the impurity and diſhonour of Whoredome, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Marriage it ſelf ſo vile and faulty; and conſequently they intangle the conſciencious ſort of men in cauſeleſs ſcruples, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden the licentious in diſſolute ways. The truth of the caſe is, That if Pleaſure be ultimately intended in this or any other act of the Animal Nature, it is a mortal ſin; but if it be intended in ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to holy and ſpiritual ends, it is no ſin at all. Pleaſure, and Luſt, which is the inordinacy of Pleaſure, are very different things. Luſt, tho it keep within the bounds of Marriage, is in it ſelf ever diſhoneſt and repugnant to Reaſon, and cannot be venial, as the Papiſts hold it to be.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the aforeſaid Doctrines of Popiſh Writers do but ſerve, according to their known deſign, to debaſe Marriage, and render it a leſs deſirable, yea a more unſafe ſtate to the ſtrictly conſciencious, that they might inhance the eſtimate of ſingle life. The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath otherwiſe determined in this caſe, That Marriage was ordained for a rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy againſt ſin, and to avoid Fornication: That ſuch perſons as have not the gift of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, might marry, and keep themſelves undefiled members of Chriſts body. Which ſhews, that to marry for the ſaid end, is not an yielding to Luſt, but a means of that Chaſtity which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the members of Chriſt to have.</p>
            <p>§ 31. Marriage being ordained, 1. For procreation of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: 2. For a remedy againſt ſin: 3. For that mutual ſociety, help and comfort that is neceſſary in this Animal life of mankind here upon earth, the ſober and regular uſe of the marriage-bed, in order to any neceſſary help and comfort, doth not defile the conſcience, but is ſanctified to the pure and conſciencious, even then, when reſpect to procreation, or the avoiding of ſin, doth not urge it. Particularly, it is no way againſt Chaſtity or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian purity, to uſe it for that neceſſary health of body which is evidently promoted by it, and eſpecially if probably it cannot be well procured without it,</p>
            <pb n="246" facs="tcp:64714:128"/>
            <p>§. 32. It hath been judged by ſome of the Ancients, to be not only ſinful, but nefarious for a man to lye with his Wife while ſhe is with child. But I find not this utterly forbidden in Scripture, either expreſly, or by manifeſt conſequence. As for the judgment of Reaſon about it, theſe things may be conſidered, 1. That by Divine perpetual Ordinance towards mankind, one Male is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one Female; whereas other creatures are not ſo limited. 2. Conception is not only the end of this duty; for it is to be rendered to thoſe that are barren. 3. That, wherein the brutes are led by natural propenſion, in man falls under the government of Reaſon. And in the preſent caſe it ſeems reaſonable, that the ſenſitive deſire either be gratified or denied, as Reaſon guided by the general Rules of Gods word, doth ſhew what is moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent within the limits of goodneſs and honeſty. This may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be determined, That if Congreſs in this caſe will deſtroy the <hi>Foetus,</hi> whoſoever uſeth it, ſinneth greatly and heinouſly. And if there be danger of deſtroying it, he that uſeth it, expoſeth himſelf to the danger of great and heinous ſin.</p>
            <p>§ 33. It is moſt certain, that there are times and occaſions wherein abſtinence from the marriage-bed is ſtrictly enjoined. The Precept forbidding to approach carnally to a woman in the time of that known infirmity which is common to that S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§ 24. The more ſolemn times of Prayer and Faſting, require abſtinence from all manner of ſenſitive pleaſures, tho in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful and honeſt; and particularly from conjugal embraces, 1 Cor. 7.5. <hi>Defraud not one another, except t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:64714:128"/>
            <p>§ 35. Not only ſolemn Religious Faſting, but other ſuch high and ſolemn acts of Religion as require the greateſt raiſing of the mind in ſpiritual cogitations, and retirement to converſe with God; and conſequently the beſt preparedneſs of body and mind, do alſo require abſtinence from the heightned delights of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive or animal part. For which cauſe abſtinence from conjugal embraces is moſt requiſite for ſome due ſpace of time before and after the particip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion of the Holy Sacrament. And I think this abſtinence ought alſo to be obſerved on the Lords day for the ſame reaſon. When the people were to meet with God in that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way upon <hi>Mount Sinai, Moſes</hi> gave it them in charge as a part of their preparation for it, That they come not at their Wives, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.15.</p>
            <p>§ 36. Yet the ordinary daily exerciſes of Religion, and Holy walking before God in them, do not require the like abſtinence. A ſober and regular uſe of Marriage, as of all other delights per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Animal life, doth not render any man unfit for the daily Service of God. With reference hereunto the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Every creature of God</hi> (and ſo every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God) <hi>is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with thanksgiving: for it is ſanctified by the word of God, and prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit with this conceſſion a caution alſo muſt here be given, That the married muſt ſo cohabit, that their prayers be not hindered or polluted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. And becauſe prayer is a daily duty, they muſt daily manage their mutual converſe, ſo as not to be indiſpoſed to, or diverted from this or any other daily exerciſe of Religion. Wherefore they muſt not indulge themſelves in this or any other high gratification of ſenſe at thoſe times wherein they ſhould every day ſet themſelves to the ſolemn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe holy exerciſes. Some due diſtance of time ſhould be always obſerved between the one and the other. But extraordinary Prayer (particularly, Prayer with Faſting) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires abſtinence for a greater interval. Chriſtians muſt keep a ſpiritual decorum, and carefully ſhun whatſoever practiſe doth not become holineſs.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:64714:129"/>
            <p>§ 37. It concerns them whoſe aim and care is that their lives may be pure and holy, to endeavour to keep themſelves from all irregularity and inordinate actings in this thing; and thereupon to watch againſt all baſe brutiſhneſs, and unſeemlineſs of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and prepoſterous ways, and abuſive dalliances in it, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are always under the eye of the Holy God. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them ſo to uſe it, as not to weaken their bodies, or corrupt their minds; as not to irritate, but to allay ſenſuality; and to have this as all other lawful gratifications of ſenſe, in a manifeſt and direct ſubſerviency to ſpiritual ends, and ſo to manage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, as that they may be able with a good conſcience to pray that it may be ſanctified to them. And there is as great need of prayer for the ſanctifying of the marriage-bed, as of any other enjoyment belonging to the Animal life; and it may be greater, becauſe Reaſon is in danger to be put much beſides its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſe.</p>
            <p>Let all that call themſelves Chriſtians, retain in their hearts a deep impreſſion of the words of the holy Apoſtle, 1 Theſ. 4 3, 4. <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctification, that ye ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fornication, that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and honour; not in the luſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God: for God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs.</hi> Chriſtians are by the ſame Apoſtle called upon to conſider, that their bodies are the members of Chriſt, and the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 19.

               <p>Further we hence learn, That prayer to God is a refuge to the afflicted, both to the Church, and to every faithful ſoul; and they find relief in it. All the diſtreſſed that take this courſe, find ſure comfort.</p>
               <p>Becauſe God is rich in mercy to all that call upon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. <hi>The ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> Yea, God is more eſpecially helpful to the diſtreſſed, Hoſ. 14.3. <hi>In thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64714:132"/>even temptations to unbelief and deſpair. They are apt to draw ſad concluſions from their outward troubles, even to conclude their being rejected of God.</p>
               <p>One great reaſon hereof, is the terror of their own guilt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience flies in their face. And if Conſcience condemn them, they think the holy God is much more againſt them. 1 Joh. 3.20. <hi>If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</hi> And ſo they are amazed.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon is, their proneneſs to judg of Gods reſpect to them, and their intereſt in him, by ſence and outward appearance.</p>
               <p>Under afflictions we are to prepare for aſſaults of ſad tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are indeed a greater burden and danger to us than the outward affliction.</p>
               <p>Our wiſdom is to prevent ſuch temptations under affliction, as may ariſe from the terror of our own guilt, and horror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: to prevent them, I ſay, by keeping peace with God, and carefully avoiding breaches with him.</p>
               <p>If upon breaches with him, ſuch terror do ariſe; our buſineſs is upon our unfeigned humiliation and repentance, to look by faith to the boundleſs mercy of God in Chriſt, and to ſtay our ſelves thereon, that we may not ſink in deſpair.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe under inward temptations we are to raiſe our Faith above ſenſe, that we may judg of Gods reſpect to us, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appearance, but according to truth. That how ſad ſoever the caſe be, we may be able to ſay there is hope concerning this thing.</p>
               <p>Now follows the prevalence of his Faith and Hope in theſe words, <hi>Yet will I look again t wards thy holy Temple.</hi>

               <p>Gods children may for a ſeaſon be born down by temptations, yet they recover themſelves after a while.</p>
               <p>They recollect themſelves, and judg of things more calmly and conſiderately; and thereupon ſee ground of hope. As the Church, Lament. 3.1. <hi>This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herewithall they ſet themſelves to reſiſt the temptation, and ſtrive againſt unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as diſhonourable to God, and hurtful to their own ſouls, and unreaſonable in it ſelf. And they reſolve to truſt in the Name of the Lord, and to ſtay themſelves on their God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. They rebuke themſelves for their unbelief, and charge themſelves to hope in God; Pſal. 42. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? hope thou in God.</hi>

               <p>And God is with them, and doth uphold them by the help of his grace. He doth alſo ſo regulate and moderate the temptation, that they may be able to bear it. And he doth open a way for them to eſcape, according to the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Let us not lye under temptations to deſpair, or deſpondence, or confuſion of mind, which diſables us to any good, and tends to drive us from God, and utterly ruine us. Let us not give way to them; for they ariſe from the darkneſs of our mind, and the evil root of unbelief, and from the malice of the Devil.

            <head>JOHN XVI. 33. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THEY who have peace in Chriſt, are liable to, and muſt look for tribulation or preſſing affliction in the world. They muſt look for all manner of temptations and trials of affliction, in mind, in body, in eſtate, in relations, in reputation, in their worldly affairs, in all things belonging to them. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. <hi>James</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſtate of the world is difficult and troubleſome. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>All things are full of labour;</hi> and the faithful in this World have their ſhare in the common condition of mankind. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9 2. <hi>All things come alike to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth exerciſe a corrective diſcipline over the godly in this world, as he did over <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs. Deut 8.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt conſider in thine heart, that as a man chaſteneth his ſon, ſo the Lord thy God chaſteneth thee.</hi> The godly are here in an imperfect ſtate, and are therein probationers for a perfect ſtate in another world; and God deals with them accordingly, to train them up for that future ſtate by preſent trouble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The faithful are liable to perſecution from the hatred of the world, which is adverſe to Chriſt, and to them upon his account. John 15.19. In the primitive and ancient times of the Church, Chriſtians ſuffered from the Pagan world. In after-times the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lamb ſuffered from the Antichriſtian Power. And at all times ſincere Chriſtians ſuffer from thoſe that have a form of godlineſs, but deny the power thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Devils hatred is great againſt thoſe whom Chriſt hath reſcued out of his power, and he will do them all the ſpight he can, as far as God will ſuffer him; as we ſee in <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe. He ſtirs up the malignant world againſt the true Church; he raiſeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt them, and makes them odious by ſlanders, and fills his inſtruments with rage; yea, by his ſtratagems he doth too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſet the Church againſt it ſelf; and makes one party of ſincere Chriſtians to perſecute another.</p>
            <pb n="258" facs="tcp:64714:134"/>
            <p>This is a brief account of the troubles of the faithful in the world. All this is done under the holy and wiſe government of God. He is the Supreme diſpoſer of all the miſchief that is done, and all the miſeries that are undergone in the world. The malice of men and devils, and the manifold temptations of the godly, he doth over-rule and diſpoſe to his holy ends.</p>
            <p>Gods Attributes are much glorified in this ſtate of things. His Holineſs and Juſtice are exerciſed, and made manifeſt in the ſufferings of the godly, in that tho he hath accepted them in Chriſt, yet he will declare his diſpleaſure againſt their ſin, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them feel ſome ſmart ſufferings. His power and mercy is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exerciſed in ſupporting them under ſufferings, and in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of ſufferings. His Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in proportioning their ſufferings to their ſtrength, ſo that they may be able to bear, and by bearing overcome. So that his people may be ſure of that which was <hi>Pauls</hi> comfort, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work; and will preſerve me to his heavenly kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Gods Attributes are glorified, ſo the good of the faithful is much promoted in this ſtate of things. For their ſufferings are corrections to humble them, trials to prove them, exerciſes to prepare them for the glory that ſhall follow, and preſervatives to keep them to it.</p>
            <p>The uſe to be made hereof, is for the patience and comfort of believers during their abode in this world. This is needful, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ye have need of patience,</hi> Heb. 10.36. And for this end God hath provided a rich treaſure of comfort for them in his word, as it is written <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>That ye through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I have ſeveral heads of Conſolation to propound, and to ſhew how they may be improved.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That tribulation in the world is well conſiſtent with peace in Chriſt, according to his words, <hi>That in me ye might have peace; in the world ye ſhall have tribulation.</hi> Yea, it furthers this peace; for it drives us under the wing of Chriſt, and makes us to abide under it.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Worlds enmity will follow Chriſts peace; perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is affixed to Chriſts followers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p>The certainty and inevitability of perſecution, doth more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſpect times and places, wherein the Devil reigns by falſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64714:134"/>Religion, as in the Pagan and Antichriſtian idolatry: to which may be added the <hi>Mahometan</hi> infidelity. Yet where true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is eſtabliſhed in the external form, ſincere worſhippers are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be perſecuted by formal worſhippers, as in thoſe times of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, wherein the true prophets were ſlain for their teſtimony by a wicked prevailing power, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29.</p>
            <p>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t this be improved, that upon this account trouble in the world may be the leſs grievous. Set a due value upon peace in Chriſt, and you will ſet leſs by trouble in the world. Indeed if you live in the enjoyment of that peace, you will quietly bear the worlds trouble. The ſoul that is lodged in Chriſts peace, is in a ſtrong hold, or incompaſſed with a ſtrong guard, and kept ſafe and ſute againſt all aſſaults, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>Secure your ſelves in this peace, by conſidering what it is. It is a peace that paſſeth all underſtanding; that is, the worth of it is incomprehenſible; for the benefits whence it flows, paſs all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. There is included in it pardon of ſin, deliverance from the wrath to come, the favour and friendſhip of God, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, and an unchangeable good eſtate, a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, and everlaſting conſolation. This is enough to quiet the mind, and ſtabliſh the heart, as it is written 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our Father, who hath loved us, and given us everlaſting conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and ſtabliſh you in every good word and work</hi> You ſee what is included in Chriſts peace; O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rize it according to the worth of it, and ſecure your ſelves in it as in a ſtrong hold; by delightful meditation.</p>
            <p>Solace your ſelves in this peace, as in a kind of Paradice; For it is that Paradice which God lets his people into upon earth; and it is ſome foretaſte and pledg of the Celeſtial Paradice.</p>
            <p>The Worlds trouble cannot drive you out of this ſtrong hold, out of this Garden of God; but it is well conſiſtent with it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth this inward peace in outward trouble, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 8. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond head of conſolation is, that there remaineth a reſt to the people of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. a perfect and everlaſting reſt.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:64714:135"/>
            <p>This God will bring his ſuffering-people to in his righteouſneſs and great faithfulneſs. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you: and to you that are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reſt is in your Fathers Houſe, in the Heavenly Manſions, in the Regions of perfect light and joy, the habitation of Angels and bleſſed Spirits, and the reſidence of the Divine Glory; where ſin and temptation cannot enter, where all danger and fears, all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and ſorrow are ſhut out for ever. Where there is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs nor ſhadow of turning in the Saints felicity, becauſe they are before the throne of God, and ſee his face. And they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know, love, and enjoy God their Father, and J ſus their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saviour; and they ſhall dwell for ever at the Fountain of Life, and Light, and Joy. Hallelujahs and triumphant praiſes ſhall be their conſtant employment, with ſuch other Services or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries as are proper to the Heavenly ſtate.</p>
            <p>Let this be improved. By the eye of Faith look to this everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace and Joy, and ſet you hearts upon it, and then you will be above the tribulation of this world.</p>
            <p>Do this in imitation of your bleſſed Redeemer, of whom it is ſaid, Heb. 12 2. <hi>that for the joy that was ſet before him, he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> For the joy that was ſet before him. Look unto this future joy by a lively act of faith, as it is the evidence of things not ſeen; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, becauſe he had reſpect to the recompence of reward; ſo let us do; and conſider with <hi>Paul</hi> how this light affliction, that is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſtir up your faith in the promiſes of Chriſt, that it may act in a lively manner. A lively faith hath a reaching ſight, it can ſee into the third Heaven. And the more you fix upon this object, the clearer ſight you will have of it. A fixed meditation on the heavenly glory, ſtrengthens the eye of faith. While we look at the things which are not ſeen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. The word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, As Shooters look at the mark with a fixed earneſtneſs.</p>
            <p>As we ſhould look to this bleſſed and everlaſting reſt, by the eve of faith, ſo we ſhould labour to enſure our right and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tle to it;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64714:135"/>to have ſuch good evidence for it, as will not fail; and to have it as clear as it can be had.</p>
            <p>This aſſurance will ſet our hearts at reſt in all the ſhakings of this world; and we ſhall thereby be quiet from the fear of evil, and ſhall have patience in the greateſt trials. This will ſet us above the tormenting fear of death, and free us from that bondage. Being aſſured of that bleſſed ſtate to come, we may welcome death in its approaches. And in caſe we be above the ſlaviſh fear of death, what can we not bear? For we know the time is but ſhort, and we are waiting for the end. Then bodily ſickneſs and pains will ſignifie to us our approaching bleſſedneſs; then bloody perſecutions and fiery trials do but call us up from earth to heaven; then poverty and nakedneſs, bonds and impriſonments, baniſhments, and all kinds of diſtreſſes and dangers, tell us we are thereby haſtening to our final ſtate, and the nearer it comes, the more we may rejoice, as knowing that we are the nearer to our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The third Head of Conſolation follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to which believers are liable, is but in the world; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this world, and terminated in this life.</p>
            <p>Should we think it hard to ſuffer in ſuch a world as this? In a world, all the glory whereof is but as graſs, and the flower of the field, and as a ſcene or ſhew that paſſeth away, and all the ſtate of it is at the beſt but vanity and vexation of ſpirit. In a world, which lies in wickedneſs, which for the greater part of it is led by the wiſdom that is earthly, ſenſual, and devilliſh; which in reſpect of the malignity prevailing in it, is as the ſuburbs of Hell; and in which ſo many men are as Devils one to another. In a world, which God hath appointed for a purgatory to the beſt of men that are in it; and to whom at the beſt it is but a ſtate of trial to humble them, and to prove them, that they may be fitted for a better world. In a world, wherein the children of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned and ſcorned, wherein they, of whom the world was not worthy, were deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented; and wherein the Prince of Life, and Lord of Glory himſelf was crucified. In a world, where n hypocrites and falſe Chriſtians reproach the Name of Chriſt by their unchriſtian converſation; and open the mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of his profeſſed enemies to blaſpheme him; and wherein ſincere Chriſtians through weakneſs of grace, and ſtrength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and by yeilding to temptation, too often grieve the Holy Spirit, and diſhonour the Name of God, and lay a ſtumbling-block
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64714:136"/>before others. Should we think it hard uſage to have a ſhare of ſufferings appointed us in ſuch a world as this?</p>
            <p>Let this be improved. Conſider we what is the true ſtate of this vain and evil world, that we may comfort our ſelves in that we do not receive our good things in it, but undergo hardſhips, and ſo have the lot of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and not of <hi>Dives,</hi> to whom it was ſaid, Luke 16 25. <hi>Remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and Lazarus evil things: now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> Let it comfort us, I ſay, that God hath not given us our portion of good in ſuch a wretched world, but hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it for us in a better; and that here amidſt our ſorrows, he hath given us the firſt fruits of happineſs.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered, That if tribulation were not moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in this preſent world, he that is infinitely powerful, wiſe and good, would not appoint it for his dear children. If the preſent ſtate of things, and the condition of this world, did not require it as beſt, all things conſidered, it would not be.</p>
            <p>Therefore concerning this appointment, look not to your own thoughts, but conſider as the heaven is high above the Earth, ſo is Gods thoughts herein above your thoughts, and his ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your ways. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.9. His underſtanding is infinite, and his mercy hath no end; and his faithfulneſs reacheth beyond our comprehenſion.</p>
            <p>Be comforted that in this dark World you are in his hand, who wiſhes better to you than you to your ſelves, and who knows bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to diſpoſe of you, than your ſelves do. Tho we are now in darkneſs, He will bring us forth to the light; and we ſhall behold his righteouſneſs. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.9. We are under afflictive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, but in a dark and diſmal World; light of perfect joy is reſerved for us in the regions of light.</p>
